In this chapter, Mrs. Wix, Sir Claude, and Maisie have a candid discussion about the recent events. Mrs. Wix reveals that Maisie's mother, Lady Ida, visited her and gave her a ten-pound note, which she interprets as a gesture of kindness and a sign of her approval of Mrs. Wix's role in Maisie's life. Sir Claude, however, laughs at this and questions Lady Ida's motives. Mrs. Wix insists that Lady Ida's actions are a sign of her recognizing the need for a "decent" person in Maisie's life. The conversation reveals Sir Claude's fear of both Lady Ida and Mrs. Beale, and his uncertainty about his next steps. The chapter ends with Sir Claude leaving the room, seemingly to seek some air and solitude to contemplate the situation.

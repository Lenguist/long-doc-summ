In this chapter, Maisie and her mother, Ida, sit together in the garden, where Ida tries to explain her decision to leave Maisie behind. She presents herself as a victim, claiming she has been forced to suffer and is now very ill, possibly planning to go to South Africa for the climate. Ida's explanations are confusing and contradictory, but she insists that she is being generous and virtuous in her decision. Maisie tries to appease her mother by mentioning a Captain they met in the Gardens, who spoke highly of Ida. However, this only angers Ida, who calls the Captain a cad and berates Maisie for bringing him up. Ida leaves abruptly, leaving Maisie alone until Sir Claude appears. They have dinner together, and afterwards, Sir Claude announces that he is free and they will go to France tomorrow. He repeats this statement several times, emphasizing his newfound freedom, before kissing Maisie goodnight and sending her upstairs.

This chapter revolves around a young girl named Maisie, who is caught in the middle of her parents' complicated relationships and their various companions. The chapter begins with Maisie parting from Mrs. Wix, a scene described as being as intense and painful as a visit to the dentist. Maisie is then collected by her father, Beale Farange, and her former governess, Miss Overmore, who is now her father's companion. The child recalls previous separations and is aware of the tension and conflicting emotions involved in these transitions.

Maisie's father and Miss Overmore engage in playful banter, which confuses and slightly embarrasses Maisie, as she does not fully understand the adult implications. She asks questions about their relationship and where Miss Overmore has been during her absence, which are met with evasive responses and jokes. Maisie is left with a vague sense of unease, but she does not push for clarity, as she has learned that it's better not to pry into adult matters. 

The chapter ends with a reflection on how Maisie has learned to navigate these complex situations, even mimicking her mother's sharpness when dealing with her own doll, Lisette. Despite her young age, Maisie is starting to understand the complexities of adult relationships and the unspoken rules that govern them. She is also learning to mask her own confusion and curiosity in order to maintain a sense of harmony and avoid further confusion.

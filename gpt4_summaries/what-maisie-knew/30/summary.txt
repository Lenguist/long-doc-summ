In this chapter, Sir Claude and Maisie have a lengthy conversation over breakfast, which reveals the complexities of their relationship. Sir Claude is deeply conflicted, feeling both a strong affection for Maisie and a sense of duty towards Mrs. Wix, who he acknowledges has been a positive influence on both of them. He proposes an unconventional arrangement in which he, Maisie, and Mrs. Beale form a small household together, leaving Mrs. Wix out of the picture. He asks Maisie to make a difficult choice between staying with him and Mrs. Beale, or remaining with Mrs. Wix. He emphasizes that he and Mrs. Beale are now her de facto parents, due to her biological parents' abandonment. Maisie requests time to think over this proposal, expressing a desire to speak with Mrs. Wix first. The chapter ends with Maisie reminding Sir Claude that she was the one who brought him and Mrs. Beale together.

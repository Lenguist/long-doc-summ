The passage is a conversation between Sir Claude and Maisie, taking place in a caf√©. They discuss their relationship with Mrs. Wix, who appears to be a governess or caretaker figure. Sir Claude is trying to convince Maisie to let go of Mrs. Wix and live with him and Mrs. Beale. He suggests that they could live in the South, where he would be close by but not living with them. He argues that their relationship is more regular now and that they have a responsibility towards Maisie due to her parents' "defection."

Sir Claude is clearly nervous and conflicted about this proposition. He acknowledges that it's an "extraordinary" way to talk to a child and admits that he's in a "tight place." He also acknowledges that Mrs. Wix has been a positive influence on him and that he respects her. However, he believes that she is an obstacle to their plans because she cannot accept his relationship with Mrs. Beale.

Maisie, on the other hand, is confused and afraid. She is attached to Mrs. Wix and doesn't want to betray her. She also expresses her reluctance to live with Mrs. Beale without Sir Claude. When asked to make a decision, she requests time to think and expresses a desire to see Mrs. Wix first.

The conversation reveals the complex dynamics between the characters. Sir Claude is trying to navigate his desires and responsibilities, while Maisie is caught in the middle, trying to make sense of the adult world. The passage ends with Sir Claude remembering that it was Maisie who brought him and Mrs. Beale together, which seems to bring him some relief.

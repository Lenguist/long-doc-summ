The passage begins with Major Carteret, his wife, and sister Clara setting out in a carriage to pick up Ellis, a young journalist who has become a favored companion of the Major. Clara is not pleased about Ellis' inclusion, as she suspects him of having romantic feelings for her. Ellis, aware of Clara's coldness towards him, is nonetheless hopeful of winning her over. The group picks up Ellis and they head out of the city, passing various sights and people along the way. Major Carteret expresses his disdain for the behavior of the local black population, hinting at racial tensions in the area.

The group arrives at a hotel by the beach, where Clara and Mrs. Carteret wait on the veranda while the Major joins a group of men discussing racial issues. Ellis stays with the ladies, but Clara is clearly disappointed that Tom Delamere, her supposed suitor, has not shown up. Ellis, knowing Delamere's habits, goes to look for him and finds him in a drunken stupor in a hotel room. Ellis decides not to disclose this to Clara, hoping to avoid spoiling her evening and potentially damaging his own standing with her.

Ellis and Clara spend the evening together, with Clara showing signs of warming up to him. However, when Delamere eventually joins them, Clara quickly reverts to her cold demeanor towards Ellis. Despite this, Ellis manages to maintain control of the situation, taking the reins for the drive home when he notices Delamere's unsteady hands. The passage ends with Clara thanking Ellis for a pleasant evening and inviting him to visit them soon, leaving Delamere out in the cold.

Throughout the passage, the author explores themes of social and racial tension, unrequited love, and the dynamics of power and status within a small community. Ellis, despite being an outsider and facing rejection from Clara, manages to navigate these complexities with tact and discretion.

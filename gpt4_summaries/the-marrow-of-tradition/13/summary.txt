The passage opens with Dr. Miller, a hospital doctor, encountering a new patient, Josh Green, a black man who used to work for Miller's father. Josh has a broken arm, which he claims was the result of a fight with a South American sailor. Miller, aware of Josh's reputation for fearlessness, suspects that Josh could have defended himself more effectively, implying that the injury might have been self-inflicted.

Josh then reveals his life's purpose: to avenge his father's murder by a member of the Ku Klux Klan. He explains that as a child, he witnessed his father being taken from their home and shot by a group of white men. One of the men's masks fell off, revealing his face, and Josh has vowed to kill this man. He is not in a hurry to fulfill his vow, as he wants to see a bit of the world first and also needs to care for his mentally ill mother, who was traumatized by the same event.

Dr. Miller is taken aback by Josh's revelation. He recalls seeing Josh's mother, known as "Silly Milly," wandering the streets, muttering to herself. He had known she was a victim of human cruelty, but he had not known the specifics. Miller reflects on the continuity of life and how the past, present, and future are interconnected. He is struck by the fact that Josh, unlike many of his race, has not forgotten the past but has shaped his life around a specific, albeit dark, purpose.

Despite understanding Josh's motivation, Miller advises him to let go of his murderous intentions, citing biblical teachings about forgiveness. However, Josh argues that forgiveness seems to be a one-sided expectation placed on black people, who are constantly given new injustices to forgive. He insists that he will not be a submissive "good nigger" and that when he gets a chance, he will kill the man who murdered his father.

Miller, recognizing the danger of Josh's plan, decides to talk to him seriously once he recovers. He recognizes that such an act of revenge would not only harm Josh but also the entire black community, which is already burdened with collective blame for the actions of individuals. Miller believes that dying for a cause is heroic, but killing for revenge is weak and should be left to divine justice.

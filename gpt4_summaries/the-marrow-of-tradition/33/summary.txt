The passage opens with a description of the Wellington riot that began at three in the afternoon on a clear day. Suddenly, the streets were filled with armed white men who ordered every passing black man to raise his hands. If the black man complied, he was searched for firearms and then warned to get off the street. If he resisted, the consequences were dire. This led to a climate of fear among the black community, with children screaming at the sight of a white man.

Dr. Miller, a central character in the passage, had been called to attend to a patient, a well-to-do black farmer, a few miles from the town. The journey, medical examination, and the return took about two hours. On his way back, he encountered a group of terrified black men and women fleeing from the town. They warned him not to go any closer to the town as the white people were planning to kill every black person they could find. Despite the warning, Dr. Miller decided to proceed towards the town as his wife and child were there.

As he neared the town, he was joined by Watson, a black lawyer, who was also fleeing due to the violence. Watson informed Dr. Miller that the white people had taken over the town's government and ordered him and several others to leave the town within forty-eight hours or face death. Watson also mentioned that he had not seen Dr. Miller's wife and child but assured him that the violence was not targeted at women and children.

As they approached the town, they were approached by a group of black men led by Josh Green. They were looking for a leader to guide them in resisting the white men's violence. Both Dr. Miller and Watson declined, arguing that resistance would be futile and would only lead to more deaths. Despite their advice, Josh Green decided to gather a group of men and resist any white man who tried to harm them. He asked Dr. Miller to ensure his mother was properly buried if he was killed in the ensuing violence. The passage ends with Josh and his group heading towards the cotton compress to gather more men for their resistance.

The passage revolves around the social aspirations of Captain George McBane and his interactions with Tom Delamere, a young man of a prominent family. The story begins with Delamere seeking amusement at the St. James Hotel, where he encounters McBane. McBane, desiring social recognition, proposes a game of poker with Delamere in his room. McBane's ultimate goal is to gain membership in the Clarendon Club, a prestigious institution that is the epitome of high social standing in the city. He sees Delamere, a member of the club, as a potential intermediary to achieve this goal.

McBane and Delamere have a history of playing cards together, with McBane being the more skilled player. On this occasion, McBane allows Delamere to win small amounts before increasing the stakes and turning the tables. Delamere ends up losing all his money and owes McBane a considerable sum. McBane, who had previously discovered Delamere's attempts to cheat him, uses this debt to his advantage. He suggests that Delamere propose him for membership in the Clarendon Club.

Delamere is initially resistant to this idea, finding it presumptuous and a clear attempt by McBane to use his power for personal advantage. However, he realizes he is in a difficult position. He cannot pay the debt, and he fears the consequences if his grandfather or other members of the club discover his gambling habits and other vices. He decides to temporize with McBane, hoping that something might intervene to remove his obligation.

In need of money, Delamere borrows from Sandy, a servant in his grandfather's house. Sandy reluctantly gives Delamere his savings, expressing his concern about Delamere's behavior and the potential impact on his grandfather's health. Delamere assures Sandy that he will use the money for a good cause and promises to return it soon.

Delamere then goes to the club and engages in a game of cards with another member, Gus Davidson. However, he is caught cheating, and a meeting of the membership committee is hastily summoned. To avoid a scandal, Delamere is given an opportunity to resign quietly from the club on the condition that he pays all his gambling debts within three days and takes an oath never to play cards again for money. Delamere agrees, but he is left with the daunting task of paying off his debts. The passage ends with Delamere contemplating his predicament and the depths of his moral degradation.

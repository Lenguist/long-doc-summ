The passage begins with a plan for Alan to hide in the fields by the roadside near Newhalls until he hears the protagonist whistling a specific Highland air as a signal. The protagonist then describes his arrival in Queensferry early in the morning. He is struck by the quality of the stone houses and the town's overall appearance, which makes him feel ashamed of his ragged appearance. 

As the day progresses, the protagonist's anxiety and despair increase. He realizes he has no proof of his identity or his rights, and he fears that even if he does have a legitimate claim, it will take time to establish it. He is also concerned about the man he is hiding, who is wanted by the authorities. He fears that if his hopes are dashed, they could both end up on the gallows. As he walks around the town, he notices people looking at him suspiciously and whispering to each other. He worries that it will be difficult to find the lawyer he needs to speak to and convince him of his story.

The protagonist is too ashamed of his appearance to approach any of the town's respectable citizens. He wanders around the town and down to the harbor, feeling lost and desperate. Eventually, he stops in front of a well-kept house and envies the dog sitting comfortably on the step. The door opens and a man comes out. The man, struck by the protagonist's appearance, approaches him and asks what he is doing. The protagonist explains that he is in Queensferry on business and asks for directions to the house of Mr. Rankeillor. The man reveals that he is Mr. Rankeillor and invites the protagonist inside.

The protagonist introduces himself as David Balfour and asks for an interview. Mr. Rankeillor is surprised and asks where he has come from. The protagonist suggests that they discuss it in private. Mr. Rankeillor agrees and leads him into a room filled with books and documents. He asks the protagonist to be brief and get to the point. The protagonist reveals that he believes he has some rights to the estate of Shaws. Mr. Rankeillor asks him to continue, asking about his parents and whether he has any papers proving his identity. The protagonist explains that his papers are with Mr. Campbell, the minister, and that his uncle, Mr. Ebenezer Balfour, would not deny his identity.

Mr. Rankeillor asks if the protagonist has ever met a man named Hoseason. The protagonist admits that he has and explains that Hoseason and his uncle arranged for him to be kidnapped and sent to sea to be sold as a slave. He managed to escape this fate, but the ship was wrecked and he was stranded on an island. Mr. Rankeillor notes that there is a gap of two months in the protagonist's story and expresses his desire to fill it in. The protagonist agrees to tell his story, but asks for Mr. Rankeillor's word that he will keep the information confidential. Mr. Rankeillor agrees, but asks the protagonist to avoid mentioning any illegal activities.

The protagonist tells his story, using pseudonyms for the people involved to avoid implicating them in any crimes. Mr. Rankeillor listens attentively, despite appearing to be asleep. He is particularly interested in the protagonist's friend, Alan Breck, who is wanted for murder. He suggests that they refer to him as Mr. Thomson to avoid drawing attention to him. The protagonist agrees and continues his story.

After hearing the protagonist's story, Mr. Rankeillor comments that it is a great epic and suggests that the protagonist write it down in Latin or English. He notes that the protagonist has a knack for getting into difficult situations and for behaving well in them. He expresses his admiration for Mr. Thomson, despite his violent tendencies, and suggests that the protagonist's troubles are almost over. The protagonist is pleased by Mr. Rankeillor's kind and humorous demeanor and feels a sense of relief at being in a clean, comfortable house and speaking with a respectable gentleman. However, he is reminded of his ragged appearance and feels embarrassed. Mr. Rankeillor notices his discomfort and invites him to stay for dinner. He leads the protagonist to a bedroom and provides him with clean clothes and toiletries, leaving him to freshen up.

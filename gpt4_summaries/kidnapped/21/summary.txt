The passage is a detailed account of the experiences of two men, presumably fugitives, who find themselves hiding in a remote mountainous region. They take refuge in a cleft named the Heugh of Corrynakiegh, surrounded by birch and pine trees, a running stream, and abundant wildlife. They spend their days fishing for trout, cooking over a concealed fire, and practicing swordplay. Despite the constant threat of being discovered by the 'red-coats', they find contentment in their simple existence.

The two men, one of whom is named Alan, devise a plan to send a message to a friend named James. Alan creates a cross from a piece of wood and decorates it with a button and sprigs of birch and fir. He explains that the cross is a coded message, intended to be interpreted by a trusted friend, John Breck Maccoll, who lives in a nearby hamlet called Koalisnacoan. Alan plans to place the cross in John's window, hoping that he will understand the message and come to their aid.

Alan's plan is successful, and John, a ragged, wild-looking man, arrives at their hiding place. He brings news of the increased presence of red-coats in the area, the discovery of hidden weapons, and the arrest of James and his servants. He also delivers a note from Mrs. Stewart, who warns Alan not to get caught and sends them all the money she could gather. John also brings a bill describing Alan and his companion, offering a reward for their capture.

The two men are alarmed by the news, but Alan remains optimistic. He writes a short note to James, asking for money, using a makeshift pen and ink, and a piece of his French military commission. John agrees to deliver the message, despite his fear. He returns three days later with four guineas and news that a reward has been issued for their capture. Despite the danger, Alan and his companion decide to continue their journey, expressing gratitude towards John for his help.

The passage begins with Mr. Utterson and Mr. Enfield on their usual Sunday walk, which takes them through a by-street and in front of a particular door. They both stop to gaze at the door, and Mr. Enfield remarks that they will never see Mr. Hyde again, a sentiment Mr. Utterson agrees with. Mr. Enfield then reveals that he discovered that the door is a back way to Dr. Jekyll's place, a fact that surprises Mr. Utterson. Despite this revelation, Mr. Utterson suggests they step into the court to look at the windows, expressing concern for Dr. Jekyll and hoping that their presence might be beneficial to him.

Upon entering the court, which is described as cool, damp, and filled with premature twilight, they see Dr. Jekyll sitting by a half-open window. Mr. Utterson greets him and expresses concern for his well-being, to which Dr. Jekyll responds that he is feeling very low. Mr. Utterson suggests that Dr. Jekyll should spend more time outdoors, even inviting him to join them on their walk. However, Dr. Jekyll declines, stating that it is impossible for him to leave, but he expresses pleasure at seeing Mr. Utterson.

Mr. Utterson, in a good-natured manner, suggests that they stay and talk to Dr. Jekyll from where they are, a proposal that Dr. Jekyll agrees to with a smile. However, his smile quickly turns into an expression of abject terror and despair, a sight that terrifies Mr. Utterson and Mr. Enfield. The window is quickly closed, and the two gentlemen leave the court without saying a word. They walk in silence through the by-street and into a neighboring thoroughfare. It is only then that Mr. Utterson breaks the silence, expressing a plea for forgiveness from God. Mr. Enfield, deeply affected by the incident, only nods in agreement and they continue their walk in silence.

The passage begins with Mr. Utterson receiving a visit from Poole, Dr. Jekyll's servant. Poole is visibly distressed and hints at something being wrong with Dr. Jekyll, who has locked himself in his cabinet. Poole expresses his fear and suggests that foul play might be involved. He invites Utterson to come with him to see for himself. They venture out on a cold, windy night to Dr. Jekyll's residence. Upon arriving, they find the household staff huddled together in fear. Poole and Utterson decide to break into the cabinet where Dr. Jekyll has secluded himself.

Poole shares his suspicions that the person inside the cabinet is not Dr. Jekyll but Mr. Hyde, a man associated with evil deeds. He recounts an incident where he saw a figure resembling Hyde in the laboratory. Poole also mentions a series of notes demanding a specific drug, which he believes were written by Hyde. Utterson examines one of these notes and recognizes Dr. Jekyll's handwriting, further complicating the situation.

Utterson and Poole decide to break into the cabinet. Inside, they find the dead body of Edward Hyde, dressed in Dr. Jekyll's clothes. They search the rest of the house for Dr. Jekyll but find no trace of him. They also find a will and a note addressed to Utterson, both written by Dr. Jekyll. The will leaves everything to Utterson, and the note suggests that Dr. Jekyll anticipated his own disappearance.

Utterson decides to return to his office to read the documents in detail, promising to return before midnight to involve the police. The passage ends with Utterson leaving the servants in the hall and heading back to his office to unravel the mystery surrounding Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

The passage is a narrative by Dr. Lanyon, detailing an unsettling encounter with his old school companion, Henry Jekyll. Dr. Lanyon receives a letter from Jekyll, which is unusual as they were not in the habit of corresponding. The letter, dated 10th December, is a desperate plea for help from Jekyll, who claims his life, honor, and reason are at Lanyon's mercy. Jekyll requests Lanyon to go to his house, break into his cabinet, and retrieve a drawer containing some powders, a phial, and a paper book. He also asks Lanyon to admit a man who will present himself in Jekyll's name into his house at midnight and hand him the drawer. Jekyll warns that neglecting any of these instructions could result in his death or mental collapse.

Despite initially suspecting Jekyll of insanity, Dr. Lanyon decides to fulfill his friend's strange request. He goes to Jekyll's house, where the butler has already arranged for a locksmith and a carpenter to break into the cabinet. After some effort, they manage to open the cabinet and retrieve the specified drawer. Lanyon examines the contents of the drawer, which include a phial of a blood-red liquor, some powders, and a book with dates and brief remarks. 

At midnight, a small man arrives at Lanyon's house, claiming to be sent by Jekyll. Lanyon is struck by the man's peculiar appearance and behavior. The man is extremely eager to see the drawer, and upon seeing it, he experiences immense relief. He then mixes some of the red tincture from the phial with one of the powders, which results in a series of color changes in the mixture. The man then drinks the mixture and undergoes a shocking transformation, revealing himself to be Henry Jekyll. 

Jekyll then confesses to Lanyon that the creature who had entered his house that night was known as Hyde, a murderer wanted by the law. The narrative ends with Lanyon expressing his horror and disbelief at the revelation, stating that it has shaken his life to its roots and left him in a state of constant terror.

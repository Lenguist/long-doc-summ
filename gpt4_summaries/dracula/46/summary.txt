The passage begins with the narrator expressing relief that Mina, presumably his wife, is no longer involved in their dangerous mission. He recounts a tense encounter with Mr. Renfield, a man they describe as a sane lunatic, who seems to have a connection with the villainous Count. The group, which includes Mr. Morris, Dr. Seward, and Lord Godalming, are wary of Renfield's potential to assist the Count in harmful ways. 

The group then embarks on a search mission, armed with various tools including a silver crucifix, garlic blossoms, a revolver, a knife, and small electric lamps. They approach a house, where they use skeleton keys to gain entry. The house is described as being eerily similar to the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb. Once inside, they begin their search, feeling as though they are not alone. The house is filled with dust and cobwebs, and they find a bunch of keys on a table in the hall. 

They continue their search, eventually finding themselves in a small, foul-smelling room. Despite the unpleasantness, they press on with their investigation. They count the remaining boxes, discovering that 21 out of 50 are missing. During their search, they are startled by a sudden swarm of rats. Lord Godalming uses a silver whistle to call three terriers, who chase the rats away. 

The group continues their search of the house, finding nothing but dust. They return to the front of the house as dawn breaks, feeling satisfied with their night's work. Dr. Van Helsing locks the house and they return home. Back at home, the house is silent except for the sounds of Renfield's moaning. The narrator decides to keep the night's events a secret from Mina, believing it is too much for her to bear. 

The passage then shifts to Mina's journal entry, where she expresses her sadness and frustration at being kept in the dark about the group's activities. She recounts a terrifying dream she had, filled with heavy, dank air and a pillar of cloud with two red eyes. She wakes feeling weak and spiritless, and spends the day reading and dozing. She has a brief, emotional encounter with Mr. Renfield, and later takes an opiate to help her sleep.

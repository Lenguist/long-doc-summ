The passage begins with Marianne's recovery from a debilitating illness. Her recovery is swift due to her youth, strength, and the presence of her mother. She moves into Mrs. Palmer's dressing room and invites Colonel Brandon to visit her, to thank him for bringing her mother. Colonel Brandon's emotional reaction to seeing Marianne's altered appearance suggests a deeper affection for her, which Elinor suspects is linked to his past relationship with Eliza, who Marianne resembles. Mrs. Dashwood, however, interprets the Colonel's behavior as simple affection.

As Marianne's health improves, Mrs. Dashwood begins planning their return to Barton. Their departure is dependent on the plans of their friends, Mrs. Jennings and Colonel Brandon. Mrs. Dashwood accepts the use of Colonel Brandon's carriage for the journey, and he promises to visit them at the cottage. The day of departure arrives and Marianne bids farewell to Mrs. Jennings and Colonel Brandon, showing gratitude and respect. 

The journey to Barton takes two days, during which Marianne remains comfortable and calm, much to the relief of Elinor. Upon arrival, Marianne becomes thoughtful and silent, reflecting on painful memories associated with Barton. However, she demonstrates a determination to adjust to her surroundings and aims for cheerfulness. She attempts to play the piano but is reminded of Willoughby, which leads her to declare her intention to practice more in the future.

The next day, Marianne appears stronger and more spirited, looking forward to the return of Margaret and the restoration of their family unit. She plans to engage in serious study and borrow books from Colonel Brandon. Elinor admires Marianne's plan but is concerned about the promise to Willoughby that remains unfulfilled. 

After a few days, Marianne ventures outside for a walk with Elinor. She points out the spot where she fell and first saw Willoughby, expressing relief that she can now look at it without much pain. She expresses regret over her past behavior and promises to improve her temper and live for her family. She acknowledges that she will never forget Willoughby, but intends to regulate her feelings for him through religion, reason, and constant employment. Elinor, seeing Marianne's readiness, begins to tell her about Willoughby's apology. Marianne listens intently but does not say a word. Upon returning home, Marianne asks Elinor to tell their mother about their conversation.

The passage begins with a conversation between Mrs. Jennings and Elinor Dashwood. Mrs. Jennings is excited about a recent conversation between Elinor and Colonel Brandon, although the specifics of the conversation are not immediately revealed. Elinor expresses her gratitude and admiration for Colonel Brandon, indicating that he has done something significant and praiseworthy. Mrs. Jennings, already aware of the Colonel's benevolence, is not surprised by his actions.

Elinor then reveals that she intends to share the news with her sister Marianne, but asks Mrs. Jennings to keep it a secret from others, including Lucy, until she has written to Mr. Ferrars. This request puzzles Mrs. Jennings, who doesn't understand the urgency of writing to Mr. Ferrars. However, she soon realizes that Mr. Ferrars is the intended recipient of Colonel Brandon's generosity, and expresses her approval.

Elinor explains that Colonel Brandon, being a delicate man, preferred someone else to convey his intentions to Mr. Ferrars. Mrs. Jennings finds this odd but does not press the matter further. Elinor then prepares to write her letter to Edward Ferrars, but is interrupted by his arrival. Edward, having been informed by Mrs. Jennings that Elinor wished to speak with him, is surprised and somewhat distressed by the news that Colonel Brandon is offering him the living of Delaford.

Elinor assures Edward that this offer is a testament to Colonel Brandon's high regard for him and his disapproval of the unjust treatment Edward has received from his own family. Edward is astonished and grateful, crediting Elinor for her role in this arrangement. Elinor modestly downplays her involvement, attributing the offer to Edward's merit and Colonel Brandon's discernment.

The passage concludes with Mrs. Jennings misunderstanding the situation and believing that Colonel Brandon is marrying Elinor to help Mr. Ferrars. When the truth is revealed, Mrs. Jennings is amused and remains optimistic about the future. She expresses her intention to visit Delaford Parsonage and insists that the Colonel should improve the parsonage for Edward and Lucy. Elinor agrees with her, indicating that they may not wait for any further improvements before marrying.

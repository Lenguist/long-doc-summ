The passage begins with a tense standoff between a group of characters and their native enemies across the river. The group includes a scout, Chingachgook, Uncas, Duncan, and two women, Cora and Alice. The scout and Chingachgook maintain a steady defense, returning fire from the natives. The scout criticizes Uncas for his poor aim, but Duncan defends him, citing Uncas's bravery and skill in saving his life. 

The tension escalates when a native warrior climbs a tree to gain a better vantage point for his attacks. The scout and Uncas coordinate their efforts to dislodge him, eventually succeeding in sending him falling into the river. Despite Duncan's pleas for mercy, the scout refuses to waste any more ammunition on the fallen enemy, highlighting the grim reality of their situation. 

Cora then suggests that the men should escape via the river, arguing that they have already done enough and should not risk their lives further. The scout is initially resistant, but eventually agrees, seeing the wisdom in Cora's words. Chingachgook silently agrees and disappears into the water. The scout follows suit after a moment of hesitation, leaving his rifle behind as a symbol of his regret over their dwindling resources.

Uncas, however, decides to stay behind, prompting Cora to plead with him to leave and seek help. After a moment of hesitation, Uncas follows the others into the river, leaving Cora, Alice, and Duncan alone in the cavern. Cora then urges Duncan to follow the others, arguing that his life is too valuable to risk. Duncan resists, hinting at a deeper connection between them. The passage ends with Cora leading Alice deeper into the cavern, leaving their fate uncertain.

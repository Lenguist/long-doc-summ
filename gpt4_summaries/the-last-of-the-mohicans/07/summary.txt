The passage begins with Hawkeye, a seasoned scout, warning his companions Cora and Major Duncan Heyward of the imminent danger they face in the forest. Despite Cora's suggestion that their enemies might be using scare tactics, Hawkeye insists that the strange sounds they've heard are beyond his understanding and therefore must be a warning of some kind. 

As they venture out of their hiding place, they are met with a serene and deceptive calmness. The party, which includes two Mohicans, takes up positions to watch for any signs of danger. Suddenly, they hear a terrifying shriek, which Duncan identifies as the cry of a horse in pain or terror. Hawkeye and the Mohicans accept this explanation, and Hawkeye instructs Uncas, one of the Mohicans, to scare off the wolves threatening their horses. 

However, they are soon interrupted by a sudden attack from their enemies. David, the singing master, is struck down, and the party retreats to a safer position. Hawkeye assures them that David is not dead, but merely unconscious, and will recover. He also warns them that their enemies will likely attack again. 

The enemies do indeed attack again, this time attempting to swim across the river to reach them. One of the attackers is swept away by the current and falls to his death, but four others manage to reach the island. Hawkeye and Uncas manage to kill two of the attackers, and Duncan and Hawkeye rush to confront the remaining two. 

In the ensuing struggle, Duncan's sword is broken and he is left to rely on his physical strength. He manages to disarm his opponent, but they grapple at the edge of a precipice. Just as Duncan is about to be thrown over the edge, Uncas intervenes, slashing the enemy's wrist and pulling Duncan to safety. The enemy falls to his death. 

Despite their victory, Hawkeye warns them that the danger is not yet over and urges them to take cover.

The passage begins with the Schlegel sisters, Helen and Margaret, attending a dinner party that is also an informal discussion club. The topic of the evening is how best to distribute wealth, with the hypothetical scenario of a dying millionaire deciding how to bequeath her fortune. Various suggestions are made, including giving money directly to the poor, funding public libraries, and providing for holidays. However, none of the proposals seem to fully satisfy the group.

During the discussion, the sisters bring up the case of Mr. Bast, a poor clerk they have recently met. They debate how best to help him, with Margaret suggesting a direct annual stipend and Helen proposing funding for a holiday. However, the group is unable to reach a consensus on the best course of action.

The conversation then shifts to Mr. Wilcox, a wealthy businessman who joins the sisters. He advises them that Mr. Bast should leave his job at the Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company as soon as possible, as he believes the company will soon go bankrupt. The sisters agree to warn Mr. Bast about this.

The conversation then turns to Mr. Wilcox's recent move from his home at Howards End to a house in Ducie Street and a country estate in Shropshire. Margaret expresses sadness at the thought of Howards End without the Wilcox family, but Mr. Wilcox assures her that his son Charles and his family still live in the area.

The passage ends with the sisters reflecting on the constant change and movement in their lives and the lives of those around them. They decide to write to Mr. Bast as soon as they get home to warn him about his job.

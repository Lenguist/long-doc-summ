The passage begins with a description of Tibby, a young man in his final year at Oxford, who is detached from the world and its concerns. He is described as indifferent to public opinion and untroubled by passions, leading a life of quiet observation. His sister, Helen, comes to visit him, bringing with her a sense of distress and urgency that is unusual for her. She has come from Oniton, where she says there has been a great deal of trouble.

Helen reveals to Tibby that she has discovered a scandal involving Mr. Wilcox, the man their sister Margaret is set to marry. Mr. Wilcox, she claims, has had an affair and ruined the lives of two people, a woman and a man named Leonard Bast. Helen is unsure whether to tell Margaret about Mr. Wilcox's misconduct, fearing that Margaret will think she is trying to ruin her impending marriage. She leaves the decision to Tibby, trusting his judgement.

Helen also reveals that she intends to compensate the Basts for the harm Mr. Wilcox has caused them. She plans to give them a large sum of money, which she asks Tibby to handle for her. The amount, five thousand pounds, shocks Tibby, but Helen insists that it is necessary to help the Basts recover from their misfortune. She makes Tibby promise to keep this part of their conversation a secret from Margaret.

Tibby carries out Helen's instructions, but the Basts refuse the money, claiming they are not in need. When Helen hears this, she orders Tibby to insist on their acceptance. However, by the time he tries to deliver the money again, the Basts have been evicted from their home and disappeared. Helen then sells some of her shares and, with the help of her stockbrokers, ends up becoming even richer than before. The passage ends with a sense of Helen's growing desperation and the unresolved situation with the Basts.

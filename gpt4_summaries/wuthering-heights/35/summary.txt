The passage begins with Mr. Heathcliff, a character who is described as avoiding meals with the family, yet refusing to exclude Hareton and Cathy. He is depicted as a solitary figure who eats once in twenty-four hours and often disappears for long periods. One night, he leaves the house and doesn't return until the next morning. The family continues with their daily activities, with Catherine and Hareton spending time in the garden. When Mr. Heathcliff returns, Catherine notes that he seems unusually cheerful and excited, which surprises the family.

Mr. Heathcliff's strange behavior continues, with him appearing joyful yet trembling. He refuses food when offered and reacts with contempt when the narrator tries to inquire about his good mood. The narrator expresses concern about Mr. Heathcliff's health, noting that he seems to be suffering from a lack of sleep and food. Despite this, Mr. Heathcliff insists that he is fine and asks to be left alone.

The following day, Mr. Heathcliff joins the family for dinner but is unable to eat. He leaves the table and spends time in the garden, causing the family to worry that they have upset him. When he returns to the house, he is still in a state of unusual excitement. The narrator tries to encourage him to eat and rest, but Mr. Heathcliff refuses, stating that he is too happy to do either.

The narrator suggests that Mr. Heathcliff's lack of Christian faith may be contributing to his strange behavior and suggests he consult with a minister. Mr. Heathcliff dismisses this idea, stating that he is close to his own version of heaven and has no need for religious guidance. He continues to act in a way that frightens the narrator, who eventually leaves him alone.

Mr. Heathcliff's behavior becomes increasingly erratic, with him spending nights pacing restlessly and murmuring to himself. The narrator overhears him calling out Catherine's name in a tone of deep emotion. Despite his strange behavior, Mr. Heathcliff refuses medical help and insists on being left alone.

The passage ends with Mr. Heathcliff's death, which occurs during a stormy night. The narrator finds him lying on his back with a smile on his face, his body cold and wet from the rain. Despite his death, rumors circulate among the local people that Mr. Heathcliff's ghost has been seen wandering around the house and the nearby moor. The narrator dismisses these stories as idle tales, but admits to feeling uneasy in the house after dark.

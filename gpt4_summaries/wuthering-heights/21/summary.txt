The passage begins with Mr. Linton instructing the narrator to take his son, Linton, to his father, Mr. Heathcliff. Mr. Linton advises the narrator not to reveal to his daughter Catherine where Linton is going, as he believes it's better for her to remain ignorant of his whereabouts. Linton is initially reluctant to leave his bed and is surprised to learn that he must travel to meet his father, a man he was unaware existed. The narrator tries to reassure Linton, explaining that his father lives nearby and that he should try to love him as he did his mother.

Linton is confused and asks why he has never heard of his father before and why his parents didn't live together. The narrator explains that his father had business in the north while his mother's health required her to stay in the south. Linton continues to question why his mother never mentioned his father, expressing his uncertainty about how to love a man he doesn't know. The narrator encourages Linton to be open to loving his father and they set off on their journey.

Upon their arrival at Wuthering Heights, Linton is initially disapproving of his new home's exterior. However, he postpones his complaints, hoping there might be some compensation inside. Heathcliff, Linton's father, greets them and inspects his son, who is visibly frightened and confused. Heathcliff criticizes Linton's frail appearance and berates his mother for not telling him about his father. Despite his harsh words, Heathcliff promises to take care of Linton and has arranged for a tutor and a comfortable room for him.

The passage concludes with Linton refusing to eat the food offered to him, causing tension between him and the housekeeper, Joseph. The narrator suggests more suitable food for Linton and decides to inform Mr. Edgar about Heathcliff's plans for his son. As the narrator leaves, Linton pleads not to be left behind, but his cries are ignored. The narrator ends their brief guardianship and leaves Linton in the care of his father, Heathcliff.

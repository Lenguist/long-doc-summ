The passage begins with Emma anticipating the arrival of a party from London, which she expects will bring a great deal of agitation and grief. However, her distressing thoughts are interrupted by the arrival of Mr. Knightley. He informs her that he has news to share, which he fears will not make her smile. Emma is quick to assume that the news must be good, based on Mr. Knightley's demeanor. However, he reveals that the news concerns Harriet Smith, a name that makes Emma flush with fear.

Mr. Knightley then reveals that Harriet Smith is to marry Robert Martin, a revelation that shocks Emma. Despite her initial disbelief, Mr. Knightley insists that the news is true and that he heard it directly from Robert Martin himself. Emma is surprised but insists that the news does not make her unhappy. She is, however, curious about how the proposal came about and Mr. Knightley provides her with the details.

The conversation is interrupted by the entrance of Emma's father. Emma uses this as an excuse to leave, feeling a need to be alone to process the news. She is filled with joy and gratitude, feeling that the only obstacle to Harriet's happiness has been removed. She resolves to become more worthy of Mr. Knightley, whose judgment she greatly respects.

The passage continues with the arrival of Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax. Emma is glad to see Frank but their meeting is initially awkward due to past events. However, they soon find common ground and Frank expresses his gratitude to Emma. He also praises Jane's beauty and reveals that his uncle plans to give her all of his aunt's jewels.

Frank then brings up Mr. Perry, a mutual friend, which leads to a shared laugh between him and Emma. Frank also teases Jane about a past misunderstanding, which forces her to smile. Emma, upon leaving, reflects on the two men in her life - Frank Churchill and Mr. Knightley. Despite her friendship with Frank, she feels that Mr. Knightley is of a higher character. The day's happiness is completed by her contemplation of Mr. Knightley's worth.

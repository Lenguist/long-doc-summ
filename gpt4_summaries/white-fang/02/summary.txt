The passage is a detailed account of two men, Bill and Henry, struggling to survive in the harsh Arctic wilderness with their sled dogs. After breakfast, they pack their camp and set off into the darkness, with the chilling cries of unseen creatures echoing around them. The daylight only lasts from nine in the morning until three in the afternoon, after which the Arctic night descends. As darkness falls, the hunting cries draw closer, causing fear and panic among the dogs.

During one such panic, Bill expresses his wish for the creatures to find game and leave them alone. Later, while preparing food, Henry is startled by a commotion among the dogs. He sees Bill standing among the dogs, holding a club and part of a salmon, indicating that an animal had tried to steal their food. They speculate that it might be a "tame wolf" that has become too familiar with human campsites.

The men are constantly on edge, surrounded by a circle of gleaming eyes in the darkness. They express their wish to reach McGurry, a presumably safer location. The next morning, they discover that another dog, Frog, has disappeared, presumably taken by the wild creatures. They curse the wild for robbing them of another dog, and continue their journey with the remaining dogs. The days are repetitive, filled with toil and the constant fear of their unseen pursuers.

Bill devises a way to tie the dogs up at night, using sticks and leather thongs, to prevent them from being taken. Despite this, another dog, Spanker, disappears. Bill refuses to drink coffee as he had vowed to do if another dog went missing. They find the stick used to tie Spanker, cleaned of leather, indicating the desperate hunger of the creatures following them.

Bill decides to take a shot at the creatures with their limited ammunition, but the she-wolf they suspect has been leading the pack cleverly evades him. They observe the wolf, noting its unusual color and size, and its familiarity with human behavior. They resolve to kill the wolf, believing it to be the cause of their troubles.

The men are constantly disturbed by the wolves, who are growing bolder. They have to keep replenishing the fire to keep the wolves at bay. Bill compares the wolves to sharks following a ship, certain that they are going to get them. Despite Henry's attempts to maintain a positive attitude, he is concerned by Bill's pessimism. As he falls asleep, he resolves to cheer Bill up the next day.

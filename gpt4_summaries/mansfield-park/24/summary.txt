The passage revolves around the characters Henry Crawford, his sister Mary, and Fanny Price, set in Mansfield. Henry decides to extend his stay in Mansfield for another fortnight and reveals to his sister his plan to make Fanny Price fall in love with him. Mary dismisses the idea, stating that Henry should be satisfied with Fanny's two cousins. However, Henry insists on his interest in Fanny, noting her improved looks and demeanor.

Mary attributes Fanny's perceived improvement to her new dress and the lack of other women for Henry to compare her with. She believes that if Henry starts a flirtation with Fanny, it would be due to his own idleness and folly, rather than a genuine attraction to Fanny. Henry, however, remains determined to win Fanny's affection, despite her initial resistance to his advances.

Fanny's brother, William, returns to England, bringing her immense joy. Henry, who was previously unaware of William's existence, takes an interest in him and his naval career, which he believes will please Fanny. Despite his efforts, he finds that Fanny's affection for her brother has already been deeply established, making his task more challenging.

William's return brings happiness to Fanny, and they enjoy their time together, reminiscing about their shared past and discussing their family. Their close bond impresses everyone, including Henry, who finds Fanny's genuine feelings and sensibility attractive. This prompts him to extend his stay in Mansfield indefinitely.

Henry admires William's tales of his adventures at sea and his heroic deeds, which make Henry's own indulgent lifestyle seem insignificant in comparison. However, he quickly dismisses the idea of leading a life like William's, preferring his own comfortable existence. Despite this, he lends William a horse for hunting, which worries Fanny due to the potential dangers. However, when William returns unharmed, Fanny appreciates Henry's kindness. The passage ends with Henry offering the horse for William's use for as long as he stays in Northamptonshire.

The passage begins by describing Fanny's elevated status in her family after the departure of her cousins. She becomes the only young woman in the drawing-room, attracting more attention and thought than ever before. Her value also increases at the Parsonage, where she becomes a welcome guest. Mrs. Grant, eager for a change for her sister, persuades herself that she's doing Fanny a kindness by encouraging her frequent visits.

One day, Fanny is caught in a heavy rain shower near the Parsonage and is invited inside. Her arrival is a delight to Miss Crawford, who had been feeling despondent due to the dismal weather. Fanny's presence provides a refreshing change and she is attentively cared for by the household. This event leads to the development of an intimacy between Fanny and Miss Crawford, although Fanny doesn't reciprocate the same feelings.

During a conversation, Fanny expresses her admiration for the growth and beauty of the shrubbery around the Parsonage. Miss Crawford, however, is more interested in discussing their differing views on wealth and status. She believes that a large income is the key to happiness and cannot understand Fanny's contentment with her modest means. Fanny, in turn, values honesty and is determined not to be poor, but she does not aspire to wealth for its own sake.

Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Edmund, who is pleased to see the friendship developing between the two women. Fanny, however, feels uncomfortable and decides to leave. As she prepares to depart, Mrs. Grant unexpectedly invites her to dinner the next day. With Edmund's encouragement, Fanny accepts the invitation, marking a new chapter in her relationship with the Parsonage household.

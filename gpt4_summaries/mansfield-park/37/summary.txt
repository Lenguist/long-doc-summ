The passage begins with Sir Thomas Crawford hoping that his niece will miss the attentions of Mr. Crawford, who has left, and regret the loss of the importance she felt while he was around. He observes her closely but finds it hard to gauge her emotions due to her reserved nature. He seeks Edmund's insight into her feelings, but Edmund does not observe any signs of regret.

Edmund is surprised that Fanny does not seem to miss Crawford's sister, Mary, who was a close friend and companion to her. Fanny, however, is troubled by Mary's future relationship with Mansfield, particularly her potential marriage to Edmund. She believes that Edmund's feelings for Mary are growing stronger, and Mary's hesitations are fading away. Edmund plans to go to town soon, and Fanny is certain that once he is with Mary again, their union will be inevitable.

Fanny's last conversation with Mary confirmed her belief that Mary, despite her kindness, was not deserving of Edmund. Fanny felt that there was little commonality between Mary and Edmund, and she doubted that Edmund's influence could improve Mary's character.

Sir Thomas, meanwhile, continues to hope that Fanny will miss the power and attention she had while Mr. Crawford was around. He believes that the absence of these will make her crave their return. He also anticipates another visitor, William, who has been granted a leave of absence and is coming to visit. William is disappointed that he cannot show off his uniform except when on duty.

Sir Thomas proposes a plan for Fanny to accompany her brother back to Portsmouth and spend time with her family. He believes this will help Fanny appreciate the value of a good income and make her wiser and happier. Fanny is delighted with the plan, as it gives her a chance to reconnect with her family.

Edmund, however, is saddened by the prospect of being away from Fanny for two to three months. He believes that the distance will help Fanny to think more clearly and lessen her distress. The only concern is whether Aunt Bertram will manage without Fanny, but Sir Thomas manages to convince his wife to let Fanny go.

Fanny writes to her mother about the plan, and her mother's response is warm and welcoming. Fanny is convinced that she will now find a loving friend in her mother. William is also pleased with the plan, as it will allow him to spend more time with his sister before he sails.

Edmund's plans to go to London are delayed due to Fanny's absence. He confides in Fanny about his feelings for Miss Crawford, and promises to write to her. Fanny is saddened by the prospect of parting from her family at Mansfield Park, and bids a tearful farewell to each room and family member. The journey begins early the next morning, with William and Fanny already one stage ahead.

The passage begins with the introduction of John Yates, a fashionable and wealthy man who is the younger son of a lord. He forms a friendship with Mr. Bertram during a ten-day gathering in Weymouth. After the sudden cancellation of a theatrical party due to a death in the family, Yates visits Mansfield earlier than expected. He is deeply disappointed by the cancellation of the play, as he was set to play a part in it. He constantly talks about the theatre and the play, finding solace in reminiscing about the past.

The idea of theatre is popular among the young people in Mansfield, and they are fascinated by Yates' stories about the play. The play was titled "Lovers' Vows," and Yates was to play the role of Count Cassel. He criticizes the casting choices made by Lord Ravenshaw and the duke, but also expresses his admiration for the performance of Agatha and the duke.

The conversation then shifts to the possibility of setting up a theatre in Mansfield. Tom Bertram suggests that they could create a small theatre in their house. However, Edmund Bertram is opposed to the idea, fearing it would be inappropriate in their father's absence and could potentially distress him. He also expresses concern about the potential expense of setting up a theatre.

Despite Edmund's objections, Tom is determined to proceed with the plan. He assures Edmund that he will take responsibility for any alterations to the house and that the cost will be minimal. He also argues that their father would actually support the idea, as he has always encouraged them to exercise their talents. Edmund remains unconvinced and insists that he will not participate in the acting.

The discussion continues the next day, with Tom's sisters also expressing their enthusiasm for the theatre plan. They dismiss Edmund's concerns and argue that there would be no harm in putting on a play among family and friends. The arrival of Henry Crawford, who brings news that his sister Mary also wishes to participate in the play, further strengthens their resolve to proceed with the plan. Despite his reservations, Edmund is unable to prevent the plan from moving forward.

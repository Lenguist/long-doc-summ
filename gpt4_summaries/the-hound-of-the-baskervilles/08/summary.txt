The passage is a letter from an unnamed narrator to Mr. Sherlock Holmes, detailing the events and observations at Baskerville Hall. The narrator describes the eerie atmosphere of the moor surrounding the hall, noting its vastness and grim charm. He mentions the traces of prehistoric people, evident in the stone huts and monoliths scattered across the landscape. The narrator also expresses his puzzlement over how these ancient people could have survived on such barren land.

The narrator then shifts focus to his mission, which involves Sir Henry Baskerville. He mentions an escaped convict on the moor, who has been missing for a fortnight, causing relief among the local residents. The narrator also mentions the Stapletons, a brother and sister living in the area, who would be vulnerable if the convict were to return. He notes that Sir Henry and he have offered assistance, but it was declined by Stapleton.

The narrator further observes that Sir Henry has taken a significant interest in Miss Stapleton, which is reciprocated. However, he notes Stapleton's disapproval of their growing closeness. The narrator also mentions the difficulty of following Holmes' instruction of not letting Sir Henry out alone, especially if a romantic relationship develops between Sir Henry and Miss Stapleton.

The letter also introduces Dr. Mortimer, an enthusiast who has been excavating a barrow at Long Down, and Mr. Frankland, a litigious man who has a passion for British law. Frankland is currently using his telescope to search for the escaped convict. The narrator also mentions the Barrymores, particularly Mrs. Barrymore, who seems to carry a deep sorrow.

The narrator then describes a mysterious event involving Barrymore. He recounts being awakened by a stealthy step in the middle of the night and seeing Barrymore walking down the corridor with a candle. Barrymore was seen peering out of a window into the moor before extinguishing the candle. The narrator expresses his determination to uncover the secrets of Baskerville Hall.

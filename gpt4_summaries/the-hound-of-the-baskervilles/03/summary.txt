The passage is a dialogue between Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, and Dr. Mortimer, discussing the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. Dr. Mortimer recounts that he saw marks twenty yards from the body, which he believes were not made by a sheep-dog, but by a large creature. He also mentions a legend about a Baskerville demon, which has been reportedly seen by several people on the moor. This has caused a reign of terror in the district, and Dr. Mortimer is unsure whether the cause is supernatural or not.

Holmes questions Dr. Mortimer about the specifics of the scene, including the weather, the location of the body, and the state of the wicket-gate. Dr. Mortimer reveals that Sir Charles had been standing near the gate for five or ten minutes before his death, as indicated by the ash dropped from his cigar. Holmes expresses frustration that he was not called in to investigate the case sooner, as the evidence has been disturbed by the weather and curious onlookers. 

Dr. Mortimer explains that he needs advice on what to do with Sir Henry Baskerville, the heir to the Baskerville estate, who is arriving soon from Canada. Holmes advises Dr. Mortimer to meet Sir Henry at the station and to bring him to Holmes the next day. Holmes also asks if anyone saw the apparition on the moor after Sir Charles's death, to which Dr. Mortimer replies that he has not heard of any such sightings.

After Dr. Mortimer leaves, Holmes and Dr. Watson discuss the case. Holmes believes that the man was running in fear before his death, and that he was waiting for someone in the yew alley the night he died. He also suggests that the cause of Sir Charles's fear came from across the moor. Holmes asks for his violin, deciding to postpone further discussion until they meet with Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry the next day.

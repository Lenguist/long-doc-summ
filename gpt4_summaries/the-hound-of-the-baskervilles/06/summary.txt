The passage begins with Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer preparing to leave for Devonshire. Before they depart, Sherlock Holmes instructs Watson to report back to him with any facts or details that may be relevant to their case, especially those concerning the relationship between young Baskerville and his neighbors, or any new information about the death of Sir Charles. Holmes also advises Watson to keep his revolver close at all times for protection. 

Upon their arrival in Devonshire, the group is greeted by the station master and porters who help with their luggage. They are also met by two uniformed men who are on the lookout for a convict who has escaped from Princetown. The convict is identified as Selden, the Notting Hill murderer, a case that Holmes had previously shown interest in due to its brutality. 

The group then proceeds to Baskerville Hall, where they are welcomed by a tall man who helps them with their bags. The man is identified as the butler, Barrymore, who informs Sir Henry that he and his wife wish to leave their service at the Hall due to the painful memories associated with Sir Charles's death. However, Sir Henry expresses his desire to maintain the old family connection and convinces them to stay.

The passage then describes the interior of Baskerville Hall, which is large, lofty, and heavily raftered with age-blackened oak. The atmosphere of the hall is somber and subdued, and the dining room is described as a place of shadow and gloom. Sir Henry admits that the place is not very cheerful and suggests that they retire early. 

Later in the night, Watson is awakened by the sound of a woman sobbing. He listens intently for half an hour but hears no other sound except for the chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall. The passage ends with Watson feeling alert and uneasy, suggesting that the sobbing woman may be a significant detail in their case.

The passage is a first-person account of the narrator's life as a slave in Master Hugh's household for seven years. During this time, the narrator learns to read and write, despite the lack of formal instruction and the active discouragement of his masters. Initially, his mistress begins to teach him, but upon the advice of her husband, she not only ceases instruction but also opposes anyone else teaching him. The narrator notes that his mistress was not initially cruel, but the institution of slavery corrupted her, turning her kind nature into one of "tiger-like fierceness."

The narrator describes the mistress's transformation, attributing it to the influence of slavery. Initially, she was a compassionate woman who provided for the needy and comforted the sorrowful. However, the practice of slavery hardened her heart and made her violent. Her opposition to the narrator's education became so intense that she would become furious at the sight of him with a newspaper, fearing the potential danger it represented. The narrator was closely watched, and any suspicion of him possessing a book would lead to immediate questioning.

Despite the obstacles, the narrator devises a plan to continue his education by befriending white boys in the street and persuading them to teach him. He would carry bread with him, which he would give to the hungry children in exchange for lessons. The narrator also discusses his growing awareness of his status as a lifelong slave, which weighs heavily on his heart. He reads a book called "The Columbian Orator," which contains a dialogue between a master and his slave, leading to the slave's voluntary emancipation. This reading deepens his abhorrence for his enslavers and his desire for freedom.

The narrator's desire for freedom intensifies to the point where he contemplates suicide. However, the hope of freedom keeps him alive. He becomes interested in the concept of abolition, although he initially struggles to understand its meaning. Eventually, he learns about the abolitionist movement through a city newspaper. After an encounter with two Irishmen who advise him to escape to the north, the narrator resolves to run away when the time is right.

In the meantime, he focuses on learning to write. He gets the idea from observing ship carpenters in a shipyard marking pieces of timber with letters indicating their intended location on the ship. He starts copying these letters and challenges boys who can write to match his skill. This method, along with copying from Webster's Spelling Book and Master Thomas's copy-books, eventually leads him to learn how to write.

The passage is an excerpt from the autobiography of Frederick Douglass, an escaped slave and prominent abolitionist. In this section, Douglass discusses his escape from slavery and his subsequent life as a free man in the North. He begins by stating that he will not reveal all the details of his escape, as it could potentially endanger other slaves attempting to flee. He criticizes the public nature of the Underground Railroad, arguing that it only serves to make slaveholders more vigilant and thus makes escape more difficult for other slaves.

Douglass then describes his initial attempts to gain financial independence. He attempted to hire his own time, meaning he would find his own work and pay his master a fixed amount each week. His master refused this request, fearing that it was a ploy for Douglass to escape. Despite this setback, Douglass persevered and eventually managed to hire his own time from a different master. He worked tirelessly to meet his expenses and save money, all the while planning his escape.

Upon successfully reaching New York, Douglass describes his feelings of excitement and fear. He was free, but also alone and vulnerable to being captured and returned to slavery. He was eventually taken in by Mr. David Ruggles, a free black man and abolitionist, who helped Douglass find work and even officiated his marriage. Douglass then moved to New Bedford, where he was surprised to find a thriving, wealthy community, contrary to his previous belief that the North was poor and uncultured.

In New Bedford, Douglass found work as a laborer and began to involve himself in the abolitionist movement. He subscribed to the "Liberator," an anti-slavery newspaper, which ignited his passion for the cause. He began attending anti-slavery meetings and, despite his initial reluctance, started speaking at these gatherings. He concludes the passage by stating that he has since dedicated his life to advocating for the abolition of slavery.

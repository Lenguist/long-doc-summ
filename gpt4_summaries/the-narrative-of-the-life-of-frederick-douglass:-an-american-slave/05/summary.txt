The passage provides a detailed account of the author's life as a child slave on Colonel Lloyd's plantation. His duties were relatively light compared to other slaves, as he was too young for field work. His tasks included driving cows, keeping fowls out of the garden, maintaining the yard, and running errands for Mrs. Lucretia Auld, the daughter of his master. He also spent time assisting Master Daniel Lloyd, who became a protector to him, preventing older boys from imposing on him and sharing his food.

Despite the relative leniency of his treatment, the author endured significant hardship, particularly in the form of hunger and cold. He was often left almost naked in both summer and winter, with only a coarse linen shirt for clothing. He slept on the cold, damp clay floor, using a stolen corn bag for warmth. His food was coarse corn meal, served in a trough like pigs, and he had to compete with other children for his share.

At around seven or eight years old, the author was sent to live in Baltimore with Mr. Hugh Auld, a relative of his master. He received this news with joy, spending the days before his departure washing off the dirt of the plantation and preparing for his new life. Despite the hardships he had endured, he was filled with hope and excitement about his future in Baltimore, a place he had heard described in glowing terms.

Upon arriving in Baltimore, the author was taken to his new home and introduced to his new mistress, Sophia Auld, whose kindly face filled him with happiness. He was given the task of caring for the Aulds' son, Thomas, and began his new life with a sense of optimism. He viewed his departure from the plantation as a turning point in his life, believing that it laid the foundation for his future prosperity. He saw his selection for this move as a sign of divine providence, despite the fact that there were many other slave children who could have been chosen. 

The author credits his deep-seated belief that he would not always be a slave as a source of hope during his darkest times. He expresses gratitude to God for this spirit of hope and for the opportunities that led him from the plantation to Baltimore, and ultimately, to freedom.

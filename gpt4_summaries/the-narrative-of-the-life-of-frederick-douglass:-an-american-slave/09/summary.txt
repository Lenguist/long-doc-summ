The passage is a first-person account of the author's life as a slave under Master Thomas Auld in St. Michael's, Maryland, beginning in March 1832. The author had previously lived with Auld seven years prior on Colonel Lloyd's plantation, but they were essentially strangers to each other now. The author describes Auld and his wife as equally mean and cruel, and notes that he was made to feel hunger for the first time in seven years due to their meager provisions. The author, along with three other slaves, were given insufficient food and were forced to beg or steal from neighbors to survive.

Auld, according to the author, was a particularly mean and cruel master. He was not born a slaveholder, but acquired his slaves through marriage. The author describes Auld as a poor man who was cruel but cowardly, and lacked the ability to effectively manage his slaves. Despite his wife's insistence, the slaves rarely referred to Auld as "master," instead calling him "Captain Auld." In August 1832, Auld experienced a religious conversion at a Methodist camp-meeting, but this did not lead to any improvement in his treatment of his slaves. In fact, the author believes Auld became even more cruel and hateful after his conversion, using his newfound religion to justify his harsh treatment of his slaves.

The author also recounts the brief establishment of a Sabbath school by a white man named Mr. Wilson, intended to teach slaves to read the New Testament. However, this school was quickly disbanded by other religious leaders who attacked the group and forbade them from meeting again. The author also describes a particularly cruel incident where Auld whipped a young, disabled woman, justifying his actions with a passage from the Bible. Despite the woman's inability to work due to her injuries, Auld refused to care for her and eventually abandoned her.

The author's relationship with Auld was fraught with conflict, with Auld finding the author unsuitable for his purposes. After nine months and several severe beatings, Auld decided to "break" the author by leasing him for a year to a man named Edward Covey, who had a reputation for "breaking" young slaves. Despite Covey's reputation, the author was glad for the change, as he was sure he would at least get enough to eat under Covey's care.

The passage describes the Hurstwood family and their residence on the North Side, near Lincoln Park. The house, a three-story brick building, is home to Hurstwood, his wife Julia, and their two children, George Jr. and Jessica. The house is well furnished, with fine furniture, soft rugs, and various art pieces. Despite its physical comforts, the house lacks a warm, loving atmosphere. Hurstwood is a reserved man, not given to much conversation or emotional display. He is content with his life, not seeking anything better unless it is immediately and clearly superior.

The Hurstwood children are growing up and developing their own personalities. Jessica, in her seventeenth year, is becoming independent and has developed a taste for nice clothes and a desire for a luxurious lifestyle. She is influenced by her schoolmates, whose parents are wealthy and successful. George Jr., in his twentieth year, is working with a real estate firm and is thought to be saving his money for investment. He is somewhat aloof, interacting minimally with his parents.

Mrs. Hurstwood is a vain woman, always striving to shine and feeling envious of those who outshine her. She hopes for a better life through her children's success. She takes pride in her husband's small real estate holdings and his stable job with Fitzgerald and Moy. The family's interactions are mostly superficial, with little deep or meaningful conversation.

Hurstwood occasionally takes his family out, maintaining a respectable public image. He is careful not to complicate his home life, as it could affect his job. He is not deeply attached to his wife, and he watches her with curiosity, aware that her vanity and susceptibility to flattery could lead to trouble. He is also concerned about the increasing expenses of the family, especially the cost of Jessica's and Mrs. Hurstwood's clothes.

Hurstwood's trip to Philadelphia without his wife marks a turning point in their relationship. He enjoys the trip and is reluctant to return home. His wife, Julia, is irritated by his lack of explanation about the trip and tries to compensate by spending more on herself. The passage ends by suggesting that the family's life, lacking in emotional warmth and filled with superficiality, is like dry tinder, ready to ignite and be destroyed.

The passage describes the life of Carrie and Hurstwood in New York City. Carrie, despite her initial disapproval, becomes fascinated by the city's atmosphere, populous streets, and indifference. She enjoys the comfort of her small flat, which is furnished with new and appropriate furniture, including a piano, as she wishes to learn to play. She keeps a servant and grows rapidly in her understanding of household management. For the first time in her life, she feels settled and somewhat justified in society's eyes. She spends a long time pondering over the arrangement of New York flats and marvels at the city's sounds, especially those from the harbour.

Hurstwood, despite his troubles, never exposes his difficulties to Carrie. He maintains his self-important air and takes pleasure in Carrie's successes. He arrives promptly for dinner each evening, and the small dining room appears luxurious to him. Carrie learns to make biscuits, and they manage to live comfortably with steaks, chops, and canned goods. As winter comes, they spend more time indoors, and Hurstwood makes efforts to meet all expenditures without showing any strain. He pretends to reinvest his money in strengthening his business for future gains. 

In the second year, Hurstwood's business increases, and he regularly gets the $150 per month he had anticipated. Carrie, being passive and receptive, accepts the situation. They occasionally go to the theatre and visit different points around the city, but they make no acquaintances. Hurstwood modifies his attitude to one of easy familiarity with Carrie, and they lead a life that doesn't arouse jealousy or comment. Carrie doesn't mind Hurstwood's occasional absences and sympathizes with his efforts.

Carrie becomes acquainted with a very handsome young woman, Mrs. Vance, who moves into the flat across the hall. They become friends, and Carrie visits her flat, which is more luxurious than hers. Mrs. Vance introduces Carrie to her husband, and they play cards together. Carrie begins to feel her life becoming stale and gloomy, and she misses the adroitness and flattery of Hurstwood. She also feels that she is not as well-dressed as Mrs. Vance, which adds to her dissatisfaction. 

Carrie and Mrs. Vance decide to go to a matinee one day, and Carrie feels inadequate compared to Mrs. Vance's well-groomed appearance and fine clothes. They walk down Broadway, a showy parade of pretty faces and fine clothes, and Carrie feels that she is not part of it. She decides not to come here again until she looks better, but she longs to parade here as an equal.

The passage revolves around the struggles of Carrie, a young woman trying to make a living in the world of theatre, and her partner Hurstwood, who is unemployed. Carrie's search for work in the opera chorus is initially fruitless, with her lack of experience and connections proving to be a significant barrier. However, after several attempts, she is finally offered a position in the chorus at the Casino theatre, much to her delight. 

Meanwhile, Hurstwood's situation is growing increasingly desperate. Despite his promises to find work, he remains unemployed and their financial situation is dire. Carrie begins to resent Hurstwood's dependence on her income, especially as she realizes she is expected to maintain their home as well as work. 

Carrie's first performance goes well, despite her initial stage fright. She is confident in her abilities and is convinced she could outperform many of the other women in the chorus. However, she is still largely ignored and undervalued, and her salary is meager. 

The financial strain continues to grow, with Hurstwood admitting that he has spent almost all of his money. He asks Carrie to support him financially until he can find work, promising to pay her back. Carrie agrees, but is frustrated and hurt by Hurstwood's lack of initiative. She encourages him to take any job, even if it's not ideal, just to help ease their financial burden. Hurstwood agrees, but it's clear that he is not enthusiastic about the prospect. 

The passage ends with Hurstwood returning to his newspaper, a symbol of his inaction and lack of motivation, while Carrie is left to worry about their future. This passage highlights the struggles of the working class, the gender dynamics of the time, and the harsh realities of the theatre industry.

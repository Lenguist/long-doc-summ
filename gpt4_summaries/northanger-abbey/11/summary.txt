The passage begins with Catherine, the protagonist, hoping for a clear day despite the morning's overcast skies. She seeks confirmation of her hopes from Mr. and Mrs. Allen, but they provide differing opinions. As the day progresses, it starts to rain, dashing Catherine's hopes of going for a walk. She expresses her disappointment to Mrs. Allen, who sympathizes with her. As they watch the rain from the window, they discuss the inconvenience of umbrellas and the likelihood of the weather clearing up. Catherine remains hopeful for an improvement in the weather until noon, when she finally gives up hope.

However, the weather clears up by itself in the afternoon, surprising Catherine. She is hopeful that her friends, the Tilneys, might still visit, but is unsure due to the earlier rain. Mr. Allen leaves for the pump-room alone as the streets are too dirty for Mrs. Allen. Soon after, Catherine spots the same carriages she had seen a few mornings back, carrying Isabella, her brother, and Mr. Thorpe. They invite Catherine to join them on a trip to Bristol, but she hesitates as she still expects the Tilneys. Despite her protests, Catherine is persuaded to join them.

On the journey, Catherine feels conflicted between the regret of missing out on a walk with the Tilneys and the excitement of the trip to Bristol. She is disappointed with the Tilneys for breaking their engagement without sending an excuse. Her disappointment is heightened when she spots the Tilneys walking down the street. She tries to get Mr. Thorpe to stop the carriage, but he refuses and continues driving. Catherine reproaches Mr. Thorpe for deceiving her about the Tilneys' whereabouts, but he defends himself.

The rest of the drive is not very pleasant, with Catherine being less agreeable than before. She looks forward to visiting Blaize Castle, but would rather not disappoint the Tilneys. They continue their journey without any issues until Morland suggests they turn back as it is getting late. Thorpe agrees reluctantly and they return to Bath. Back home, Catherine learns that a gentleman and lady had called for her while she was out. She spends the evening with the Thorpes, feeling disturbed and out of spirits. Despite her disappointment, Isabella seems content with their evening indoors, expressing relief at not attending a ball at the Lower Rooms. Catherine feels that Isabella lacks empathy towards her situation. The passage ends with Catherine retiring to bed, reflecting on her day.

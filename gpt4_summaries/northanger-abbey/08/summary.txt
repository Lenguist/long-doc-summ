The passage begins with a party from Pulteney Street, including Catherine and James Morland, arriving at the Upper Rooms for a ball. They meet with the Thorpes, and Isabella Thorpe and Catherine exchange pleasantries before entering the ballroom. James Morland is eager to dance with Isabella, but she refuses until Catherine can join them. However, she eventually leaves Catherine to dance with James, leaving Catherine feeling disappointed and left out.

Catherine is then left in the company of Mrs. Thorpe and Mrs. Allen, feeling somewhat disgraced for not having a dance partner. Her spirits are lifted when she spots Mr. Tilney, whom she assumes is accompanied by his sister. Catherine is interested in getting to know Miss Tilney and attempts to engage her in conversation. However, their conversation is limited due to interruptions and Catherine's own nervousness.

Catherine is then approached by her friend Isabella, who has been looking for her. Isabella is in high spirits and eager to gossip, but Catherine is more interested in pointing out Mr. Tilney and his sister. Isabella is thrilled to see them and expresses a desire to meet Mr. Tilney. However, Isabella then resists James' invitation to dance again, arguing that it would be improper and cause a stir. Despite this, she eventually agrees to dance with him again.

Catherine, hoping to see Mr. Tilney again, returns to Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Thorpe, but is disappointed to find that he is not there. Mrs. Thorpe praises her son John, and Mrs. Allen mentions that Mr. Tilney had expressed a desire to dance. Catherine is disappointed to see Mr. Tilney dancing with another lady. John Thorpe then approaches Catherine and suggests they dance again, but she declines, claiming to be tired. The rest of the evening is dull for Catherine, as Mr. Tilney is occupied with his dance partner and James and Isabella are engrossed in their own conversation.

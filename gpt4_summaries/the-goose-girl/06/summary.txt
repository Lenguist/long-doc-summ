The passage begins with a description of Krumerweg, a crooked, shadowy street that has seen better days. Despite its poverty, it is home to many kind and loyal hearts. Among its residents is Gretchen, a young woman in love with a vintner, who she plans to marry after the vintage. The vintner reciprocates her feelings, but also carries a deep, unspoken sorrow in his heart. Gretchen lives with her grandmother, who is the owner of their house and their only barrier against poverty. 

One evening, Gretchen brings the vintner home to meet her grandmother. The old woman, who has the ability to read palms, sees a future of riches, power, and war for the vintner, which he seems to welcome. However, she also assures him that he will live a long life and that he means well for Gretchen. The vintner, in turn, promises to love and protect Gretchen. The old woman blesses their union and they leave her to rest. 

As Gretchen and the vintner part ways, a carriage stops outside their house. A veiled lady and a man, both of whom have visited before, climb the stairs to the upper floors. The vintner, troubled by his feelings for Gretchen and the future foreseen by her grandmother, leaves in a state of turmoil. 

The passage then shifts to Carmichael, a man who is deeply in love and is grappling with his feelings. He encounters Colonel Wallenstein, who expresses his fascination with Gretchen. Carmichael warns Wallenstein to respect Gretchen and threatens to report any ill-treatment to the police and the chancellor. Wallenstein leaves in a huff, leaving Carmichael to ponder over his actions. 

Carmichael later spots a carriage carrying the chancellor, who he follows to the royal gardens. He hires the same carriage and learns from the coachman that the chancellor and the veiled lady had visited number forty in Krumerweg. Intrigued, Carmichael decides to investigate further if he sees the chancellor's carriage at the palace again. 

Finally, the passage introduces Hans Grumbach, a man from New York who arrives at Carmichael's hotel. The concierge informs Carmichael of Grumbach's arrival, but he dismisses it as unimportant. Little does he know that Grumbach's arrival is about to bring significant changes.

The passage begins with a conversation between Carmichael and Grumbach, where Carmichael questions Grumbach about his past. Grumbach reveals that he was once a gardener's boy who fell in love with a woman named Tekla. In his desperation for money, he accepted a bribe from a Gipsy to provide information about the route of a princess's carriage. This information led to the princess's abduction, a crime for which Grumbach became an accessory. After the abduction, Grumbach fled and joined a group of Magyar Gipsies. Despite a reward being offered for the return of the princess, no one claimed it, and Grumbach lived with the guilt of his actions.

Carmichael, who is not judgmental about Grumbach's past actions, advises him to leave the country to avoid possible arrest. Grumbach, however, feels compelled to stay due to his conscience. He later encounters Tekla, who is now a married woman with children, and feels a sense of closure. He also meets Gretchen, a young woman who is about to be married. He notices a scar on Gretchen's arm, which triggers a memory and leads him to believe that she may be the abducted princess.

In the final part of the passage, Grumbach bumps into the Gipsy who bribed him years ago. Recognizing him, Grumbach confronts the Gipsy, revealing his identity as the gardener's boy from the past. The passage ends on a cliffhanger, leaving the reader in suspense about the consequences of this encounter.

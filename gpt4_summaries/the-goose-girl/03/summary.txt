The passage is set in the city of Dreiberg during a chilly September night. The protagonist, Carmichael, is an American consul who is drawn to the palace and a particular lighted window. He is aware of the impossibility of his attraction, presumably to a woman of higher status, but he cannot help himself. Despite being well-received by the locals, he feels a sense of dissatisfaction and yearns for something more.

Carmichael is an Irish-American who has lived and studied in various places. He fought in the Civil War, earning a captaincy and sustaining multiple injuries. After the war, he felt restless and secured a position as a consul in Ehrenstein. Despite his usual wanderlust, he has remained in Ehrenstein for two years, leading those who know him to suspect that a woman is the reason for his unusual stability.

One evening, Carmichael encounters a goose-girl named Gretchen. He is intrigued by her knowledge of literature and music, which seems unusual for someone of her social status. He offers his assistance if she ever finds herself in trouble, and she promises to remember his offer.

Later, Gretchen is joined by Leo, a young vintner who is in love with her. Leo is suspicious of Carmichael, but Gretchen assures him that the consul means no harm. The two share a romantic moment, but Gretchen is troubled by the fact that she only sees Leo at night and does not know what he does during the day. 

Meanwhile, Carmichael is intrigued by a veiled woman who arrives at the royal gardens in a carriage. He wonders who she might be, but dismisses her as a lady-in-waiting with a clandestine affair.

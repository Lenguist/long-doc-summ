The passage begins with Adam and Dinah walking together, though not arm-in-arm, as Adam has noticed that Dinah does not walk this way with Seth, Adam's brother. Adam asks Dinah if she is happy to make the Hall Farm her home, expressing his disappointment that she does not seem to want to do so, despite the affection the family has for her. Dinah responds that while she loves the family and cares for their welfare, she feels called back to her previous work. She believes that she should not run from the work God has given her in search of personal happiness. She also mentions that she may return if her aunt's health fails or if she is otherwise needed.

Adam respects Dinah's decision, stating that he does not believe she would go against the wishes of those who love her without a good reason. He expresses his deep affection for her, wishing that she could have been his sister and lived with them all their lives. However, he acknowledges that Dinah's feelings are different and perhaps he is overstepping by speaking about it. Dinah does not respond, and they continue walking in silence.

Later, they meet Seth, who is aware of Dinah's intention to leave. Seth has been feeling depressed, as he has been in love with Dinah and knows she will never marry him. However, he appears content and calm when they meet. When they arrive at the cottage, Lisbeth, their mother, is seated in her arm-chair, too tired to greet them at the door. She expresses her longing to see Dinah and her frustration at being left alone.

The passage then delves into Adam's state of mind, explaining that he has not yet moved on from his sorrow and that he believes good carpentry is God's will. He has been growing more affectionate towards Seth and his mother, and he values his friendship with the Poysers. He holds Dinah in high regard and is content with the thought of her, even if she chooses to leave. He expresses his feelings to Dinah, who assures him that she does not think ill of him.

In the end, the passage reflects on the subtle signs of love, comparing them to the first signs of spring. It suggests that love, like these signs, is a great and beautiful thing, and even the smallest signs of it are significant.

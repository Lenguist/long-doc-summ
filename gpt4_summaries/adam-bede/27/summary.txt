The passage is set in the north midland county of Loamshire in the middle of August, during the wheat reaping season. The farmers of Broxton and Hayslope have not been affected by the heavy rains that have been causing damage throughout the country. They are not particularly concerned about the rising price of bread as long as they can gather their own corn undamaged. The eighteenth of August is a particularly sunny day, raising the spirits of the farmers and their families.

The protagonist, Adam, has been working double shifts as a foreman for Jonathan Burge. He has been doing this cheerfully as his hopes about Hetty, a young woman he is fond of, have been buoyant. He has noticed that she has been kinder to him since his birthday, leading him to believe that she has forgiven his past coldness. He has high hopes for their future, believing that she will make a good wife.

Adam is also busy with some repair work at the Chase Farm, which is rumored to be let to a new tenant. He discovers that some old roofing needs to be replaced and comes up with a plan to rebuild it into a convenient cow-shed and calf-pen. He is so engrossed in his work that he doesn't notice that his brother Seth has left his basket of tools behind.

As the sun begins to set, Adam decides to take a shortcut home through the Chase and the Grove, a place he hasn't visited in years. As he walks, he is lost in thought about Arthur Donnithorne, a friend who is due to leave soon. He admires Arthur and is fond of their boyish companionship. However, his thoughts are interrupted when he sees Arthur and Hetty standing together in the Grove. He is shocked and hurt, feeling betrayed by Arthur.

Adam confronts Arthur, accusing him of leading Hetty on and damaging her reputation. Arthur tries to dismiss Adam's accusations, claiming that he didn't know Adam loved Hetty and that he didn't mean to hurt him. However, Adam is not convinced and challenges Arthur to a fight. The two men fight fiercely, but Adam, being stronger, eventually knocks Arthur out. Adam is horrified when he realizes that Arthur is not moving and appears to be dead. The passage ends with Adam kneeling beside Arthur's lifeless body, filled with despair and regret.

The author then reflects on the changes in the clergy over the past sixty years, suggesting that zealous clergymen were not as common in the past as they are now. He argues that a zealous clergyman in the past would likely have been seen as tasteless and indiscreet, and that people's expectations of clergy often do not align with reality.

The author then discusses the importance of sympathy and understanding in our interactions with others.

He emphasizes the beauty and value in ordinary, everyday life and objects, and criticizes those who dismiss them as vulgar or unimportant. 

The author goes on to discuss the importance of humility and sincerity in religion, using the contrasting examples of Mr. Irwine and Mr. Ryde. He praises Mr. Irwine for his humility, respectfulness, and practical wisdom, while criticizing Mr. Ryde for his overemphasis on doctrine and his lack of practical wisdom and understanding. He argues that true religion is about feelings and actions, not just doctrines and notions.

The passage concludes with the author reflecting on his own experiences with ordinary people, and the deep admiration and love he has developed for them. He criticizes those who dismiss ordinary people as unworthy of their attention or respect, arguing that these people are the ones who truly make up the world and deserve our love and understanding.

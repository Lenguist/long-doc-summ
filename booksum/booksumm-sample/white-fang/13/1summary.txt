{"name": "chapter 5", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang17.html", "summary": "In this chapter, White Fang is being trained as a sled-dog. Gray Beaver, Kloo-kooch, and Mit-sah go on a journey up the Mackenzie River. Gray Beaver drives a sled drawn by dogs that he has traded or borrowed. Mit-sah, who is learning to drive and train the dogs, drives a smaller sled drawn by puppies. The sled carries nearly two hundred pounds of gear and food. White Fang has a moss-stuffed collar put around his neck; it is connected by two pulling traces to a scarp that passes around his neck and over his back. A long rope, by which he pulls the sled, is fastened to this. There are seven puppies in the team, some nine and ten months old; White Fang is eight months old. The sled that he pulls is one that does not move over the snow easily, helping to distribute the weight. Also, the ropes of varying lengths prevent the dogs from actually attacking the dogs in front of them. Lip-lip is at the end of the longest rope, leading the team, a fact that enrages the other puppies behind him, making them chase him and increasing the overall speed. What further enrages the other dogs is that Mit-sah favors Lip-lip over them. White Fang does well as a sled dog even though he still fights with the other puppies when he can. Usually, however, he is too busy working. His team pulls the sled for months until they reach a village at the Great Slave Lake. There, White Fang eats some chips of frozen moose meat that a village boy has been chopping. The boy tries to beat White Fang, who in turn bites him. The boys family is angry, but Gray Beaver defends him. The village boys come after Mit-sah, but they are also bitten by White Fang. It is obvious that he has learned to guard property, protect his master, and attack thieving strangers.", "analysis": ""}

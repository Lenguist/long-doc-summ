She reminds the reader that her goal, however, is a faithful reprint of life as it actually is. Eliot does not want to represent people as more clearly good and evil than is the norm in real life. She admires the Dutch painters who are realists more than those who paint angels. She believes in beauty of form, but she also thinks that realism has its own type of beauty and that there are so few true heroes and heroines in the world that it would be a waste of time to devote too much written material to them. Besides, it does not matter so much that the vicar is sound in terms of his doctrine as that he is loved. So the vicar is better, although he is not a very good preacher. Eliot observes that heroes are often not what they are built up to be", "analysis": "Chapter Seventeen is crucial to the literary philosophy of the book. Eliot steps back to explain why she has chosen the subject matter that she has.  This chapter could be referred to as meta-literary, because it does not advance the plot at all but instead airs the author's literary theories. The style of writing that Eliot supports is a sort of working-class realism.  The most famous line in the novel is in this chapter: \"And I would not, even if I had the choice, be the clever novelist who could create a world so much better than this, in which we get up early in the morning to do our daily work.\"  Eliot holds that literary integrity stems from an exact replication of real life.  The Dutch masters whose paintings she so appreciates almost undoubtedly mean people including Rembrandt and Van Eyck, who took peasants as their subjects. In Chapter Eighteen, it is interesting that Eliot often puts her comments on human nature in the mouths of various characters, considering that she has already given herself a strong narrative voice in the novel.  The characters who most often seem to hold Eliot's points of view are the female characters, especially Mrs. Poyser, whose commentary on old age seems to come straight from the author.  This can be chalked up to the fact that while Adam Bede is a novel, it is also a treatise on both literary style and human nature. In Chapter Nineteen, Eliot gives Adam a healthy variety of virtues. On the one hand he is a strong and noble laborer, sure of his craft, able to imagine perfection, able to give advice to others. On the other hand he has the moral strength of an honest artisan who makes the most of his potential each day, almost to the awe of those who can appreciate his hardworking character. Moreover, Adam has risen above the virtue of the simple worker. He has advanced himself through schooling and through reading good books. He can think thoughts that the average laborer cannot think. Even so, during his three-mile walk, he chooses to think dreamily about the future and how he will be able to become a success in order to be worthy of marrying Hetty, rather than about the ideas he might have found in the writings of Bunyan or Franklin.  Also, it is not clear that these virtues are given merely from Adam's own perspective of self-esteem rather than from the narrator's honest assessment of his character. Eliot observes in Chapter Twenty that often men mistake the signs that a woman is in love with someone else as the signs that she is in love with him.  While she claims to be a realist, opinions such as these occasionally cause Eliot to come off as more of a cynic.  She also writes that Adam has no way of knowing this general truth because he has not had the opportunity to read many novels and see how women act when they are in love.  This is an unsubtle self-promotion of her own work, in that she claims that her novel is not only entertaining but also educational. The theme of costuming arises in this chapter, with Hetty's quick switch from wearing a flower behind her ear to wearing Dinah's Methodist cap.  She makes the switch when she sees that Adam is displeased with her vanity; although she is not in love with him, she cannot bear to lose the attentions of any man.  As transgressive as wearing a flower in her hair is, being reminiscent of prostitution, wearing Dinah's cap as mere adornment is even more transgressive because it has definite religious implications. A lot of Eliot's novel is taken up with sorting the young Bedes and the relatives of the Poysers into various possible matches.  Dinah could marry Seth or possibly Adam; Hetty could marry Adam or possibly the Captain.  Chapter Twenty-One, therefore, pulls short the notion that such alliances are necessary or even advisable.  By showing a bachelor whose home functions at least as well or better than that of a married man, Eliot hints at the possibility that none of the matches might work out in the end. But even her depiction of a happy unmarried man has some flaws.  First, there is the possibility that Bartle was married at some point in his life before, leaving the question of whether it is more likely to reach a happy bachelorhood only after having been married.  Second, he is now in possession of a family of his own, whether he likes it or not.  His female dog has given birth to pups, and because he calls her a \"woman,\" he does have some elements of a family after all."}

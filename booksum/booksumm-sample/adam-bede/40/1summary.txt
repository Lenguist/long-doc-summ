Who is it? Mrs. Poyser? Seth? Dinah? Which one of these kind, good people will be taken from us? Which one will--oh wait, it's old Squire Donnithorne, \"found dead in his bed\" . Nobody liked him anyway. Phew. When Mr. Irwine gets back, this is the first news he hears . Thankfully, Mr. Irwine is no gossip-monger. He doesn't tell his mother what he's been up to, and braces himself \"for the morning's heavy duty of carrying his sickening news to the Hall Farm and Adam's home\" . Adam hasn't quieted down at all during Mr. Irwine's absence. Not a smidge. In fact, he seems more determined than ever to pin Hetty's crime on Arthur. Mr. Irwine doesn't deny Arthur's \"sad part in the story of sin and sorrow\" . But he persuades Adam that vengeance is not the biggest priority. Tell that to the people at the Hall Farm. Really, we're not being sarcastic: vengeance shouldn't be a priority now. The Poysers are all reeling from \"a misfortune felt to be worse than death\" now that they know of Hetty's crime . They all feel sorry for Adam, definitely. But they're facing the prospect of leaving the area they've known and loved, generation after generation. How would vengeance solve that? The Poysers, at a loss for any other reaction, send for Dinah. But now that Lisbeth Bede knows the news, she's also sent for Dinah. Oh Dinah, where art thou? All of Hayslope is worried and quiet and depressed. It's gotten so bad that Bartle Massey has even put his misogyny on hold. Get us Dinah, pronto. Since Dinah is still away, Mr. Irwine and good old Bartle hold a meeting. Mr. Irwine admits that Hetty may be doomed: \"I'm afraid it will go hard with her. The evidence is very strong. And one bad symptom is that she denies everything\" . Bartle can't say much good about Hetty , but sure does want to help Adam. He decides to shut up his school and \"go to Stoniton to look after Adam till this business is over\" . Though Irwine decides to stay in Hayslope for the time, he likes Bartle's plan. So Bartle runs off. Maybe Bartle Massey will never be as in-demand as Dinah. But he's in demand now. Relish it, Bartle! It's your turn to shine.", "analysis": ""}

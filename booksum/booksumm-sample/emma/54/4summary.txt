He tells her that Mr. Martin and Harriet Smith are going to be married. Emma is shocked, and Mr. Knightley thinks that she is taking the news bad because she does not want Harriet to marry Mr. Martin. Emma is quite relieved though, and tells him that she does not think it is a bad idea, she is just surprised. He tells her that Mr. Martin had gone to John Knightley's on business for him and had seen Harriet there. They had renewed their friendship, and when he asked for marriage, she accepted. He had come back to Highbury and told Mr. Knightley the news, and Mr. Knightley told him to go to Mrs. Goddard's to ask about her family. He tells her that he thinks it a good match, and that he had gone out of his way to get to know Harriet for Emma and Robert Martin's sake. Emma is quite happy for Harriet and relieved that she can now be happy with Mr. Knightley without worrying about her. Emma and her father go to the Westons' to visit the baby, and they find Frank and Jane there.

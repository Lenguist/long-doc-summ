The passage describes a journey undertaken by Grey Beaver, Mit-sah, and Kloo-kooch up the Mackenzie. They travel using two sleds, one driven by Grey Beaver and the other by Mit-sah. The second sled, harnessed by a team of puppies, is used to train the dogs and carry nearly two hundred pounds of supplies. White Fang, one of the puppies, is introduced to the harness for the first time, and he doesn't resist it much as he has seen other dogs in the camp working in it.

The sled team consists of seven puppies, including White Fang who is the youngest. Each dog is fastened to the sled by a single rope of varying lengths to avoid any dog stepping on another's footprints. This fan-formation also prevents dogs from attacking each other from the rear. The sled itself is a birch-bark toboggan designed to distribute the weight over the largest snow-surface.

Mit-sah, who resembles his wise father, Grey Beaver, takes revenge on Lip-lip, a dog who had previously persecuted White Fang, by putting him at the end of the longest rope. This position, while seemingly an honor, actually makes Lip-lip a target of hatred and persecution by the pack. The other dogs, seeing Lip-lip always running away, develop a desire to chase him. Mit-sah further fuels their jealousy by favoring Lip-lip with meat, causing the other dogs to rage with envy.

White Fang, who has learned to obey the gods (humans) and has accepted their mastery, works hard and shows faithfulness and willingness in his toil. He fights with the other dogs, returning the aggression they had shown him when Lip-lip was the pack leader. Despite his solitary nature, White Fang could have become the pack leader, but he chooses to ignore the other dogs, demanding respect and maintaining his isolation.

White Fang learns the law of property and the duty of defense of property. He protects his god's possessions fiercely, even against other gods. He learns that thieving gods are usually cowardly and prone to run away at the sounding of the alarm. He also learns that it's not fear of him, but fear of Grey Beaver that drives the thief away. His solitary nature makes him an excellent guard dog, a role that Grey Beaver encourages and trains him for.

The bond between White Fang and his human masters strengthens over the months. He exchanges his liberty for the possession of a flesh-and-blood god, receiving food, fire, protection, and companionship in return. His service to his god is one of duty and awe, but not of love, as he does not know what love is. His allegiance to man is greater than his love for liberty, kind, and kin.

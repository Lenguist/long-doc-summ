The passage details the experiences of White Fang, a wolf-dog hybrid, as he navigates life in a human camp. The narrative begins with White Fang exploring the camp and learning about the ways of the humans, who he perceives as god-like figures. He quickly learns to respect and fear them due to their superior strength and mysterious powers. Unlike humans, whose gods are unseen and abstract, White Fang's gods are tangible and real, represented by the humans in the camp. 

White Fang begins to submit to the humans, giving them the right of way and obeying their commands. He learns that they have the power to hurt him, and that his actions are under their control. This submission goes against his wild nature, but he begins to find comfort in the predictability and security it provides. However, this process of submission is gradual and not without conflict. He still feels the call of the wild and occasionally ventures to the edge of the forest, longing for his previous life of freedom.

White Fang also learns about the social dynamics in the camp. He realizes that men are more just, children are cruel, and women are kind. He also learns to avoid the mothers of puppies after a few painful encounters. However, his main tormentor is Lip-lip, an older and stronger dog who constantly bullies him. This constant persecution makes White Fang more aggressive and cunning. He becomes a skilled thief and learns to avoid Lip-lip.

One day, White Fang lures Lip-lip into a trap, leading him to his mother, Kiche, who attacks Lip-lip. This gives White Fang a sense of revenge. However, his joy is short-lived as his mother, Kiche, is taken away by a human named Three Eagles. White Fang tries to follow her but is beaten by Grey Beaver, another human. This beating teaches him that he must never bite a human, the ultimate crime in his new world.

White Fang mourns for his mother, but he also begins to adjust to his new life. He learns to obey Grey Beaver, who occasionally rewards him with food and protects him from other dogs. Despite the harsh conditions, White Fang starts to form a bond with Grey Beaver. The passage ends with the suggestion that White Fang is slowly becoming domesticated, finding a strange comfort in his new life, even as he yearns for his mother and the freedom of the wild.

The passage begins with the story of a man named Jim Hall, a convict who escaped from San Quentin prison. Hall is described as a ferocious man, shaped by a harsh society into a human beast. Despite the harsh punishments he received in prison, Hall remained unbroken, his spirit only growing fiercer with each beating. His third term in prison saw him clash with a particularly cruel guard, leading to Hall being confined to an iron cell for three years, where he lived in darkness and isolation, growing to hate all things. One night, Hall managed to escape the prison, leaving dead guards in his wake. His escape sparked a manhunt, with citizens and law enforcement alike pursuing him for the bounty on his head.

However, it is revealed that Hall was innocent of the crime for which he was sentenced. He had been framed by the police, with the judge, Judge Scott, unknowingly sentencing him to fifty years in prison based on false evidence. Hall, believing the judge to be part of the conspiracy, vowed revenge in the courtroom. After his escape, he disappeared, with false claims of his death appearing across the region.

Meanwhile, at Sierra Vista, the residents read the news of Hall's escape with anxiety, especially Judge Scott, who had sentenced Hall. The passage then introduces a dog named White Fang, who was allowed to sleep in the house by Alice, the master's wife. One night, White Fang sensed an intruder and attacked, resulting in a violent struggle. The intruder was revealed to be Jim Hall, who was killed by White Fang. The dog, however, was severely injured in the fight.

Despite his injuries, White Fang survived thanks to the care of the Scott family and the surgeons. His recovery was slow and painful, with him having to relearn how to walk. Once he was able to move again, he was taken outside, where he encountered Collie, a dog with her puppies. Despite initial tension, White Fang eventually interacted peacefully with the puppies, much to the delight of the onlooking humans. The passage ends with White Fang, now dubbed the "Blessed Wolf", resting in the sun, surrounded by the puppies.

The passage tells the story of White Fang, a wolf who has been domesticated and is living in Sierra Vista, the home of Judge Scott. White Fang is initially averse to friendship with the other dogs in the house, preferring to keep to himself. However, he eventually learns to coexist with them, even though he never truly warms up to them. He also learns to differentiate between the family members and the servants of the household, treating the former with more respect and affection.

White Fang's relationship with Collie, another dog in the household, is fraught with tension. Collie harbors a deep-seated resentment towards him due to the crimes he and his kind have committed against her ancestors. She often picks on White Fang and makes his life miserable in small ways, but he never retaliates, showing restraint and patience.

White Fang also has to learn to navigate the complex social hierarchy of the household. He learns to recognize the different members of the family and the degree of favor they enjoy with the master. He treats them accordingly, valuing what the master values and guarding it carefully. He learns to tolerate the children, even though he dislikes them. He also learns to respect Judge Scott, the master, and shows him the most affection.

White Fang's life in Sierra Vista is a far cry from his life in the Northland. He has to learn many new rules and laws, such as not attacking the chickens, cats, rabbits, and turkeys that belong to other gods. He learns these laws through experience and the master's guidance. He also learns to control his natural impulses and adjust his actions according to the rules of civilization.

However, White Fang's domestication is not without its challenges. He is often targeted by small boys who throw stones at him, and he has to resist the urge to retaliate. He also has to deal with other dogs that attack him. Despite these challenges, White Fang learns to adapt to his new life, showing remarkable resilience and adaptability.

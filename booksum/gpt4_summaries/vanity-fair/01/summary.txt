The passage begins with a detailed description of a grand family coach arriving at Miss Pinkerton's academy for young ladies, located on Chiswick Mall. The coach is driven by a fat coachman and accompanied by a black servant named Sambo. The arrival of the coach causes a stir among the young ladies at the academy, including Miss Jemima Pinkerton, who recognizes the coach as belonging to Mrs. Sedley.

Miss Jemima informs her sister, Miss Pinkerton, of the arrival and they discuss the preparations for Miss Sedley's departure from the academy. Miss Pinkerton, a majestic and respected figure, reminds her sister to use proper language and to ensure all administrative tasks related to Miss Sedley's departure are completed. Miss Jemima confirms that the girls have been packing Miss Sedley's trunks and that they have prepared a bouquet and two bottles of gillyflower water for Mrs. Sedley.

Miss Pinkerton then writes a formal letter to Miss Sedley's parents, praising her for her accomplishments and virtues. She also mentions that Miss Sharp, another student, will be accompanying Miss Sedley and requests that her stay in Russell Square not exceed ten days. Miss Pinkerton's letters are a rare and significant event, only written when a student leaves the academy, is about to get married, or in the unfortunate event of a student's death.

The passage then shifts to a description of Miss Amelia Sedley. She is described as a kind-hearted, talented, and well-loved young lady. She is not only academically gifted but also has a generous and gentle heart, winning the love of everyone around her. Despite her many virtues, she is also described as being overly emotional, often crying over minor incidents.

On the day of her departure, Miss Sedley is torn between happiness and sadness. She receives numerous gifts and promises to write to her friends regularly. Miss Sharp, on the other hand, is largely ignored and leaves the academy without much fanfare. The departure is marked by a flurry of emotions, with many tears shed and heartfelt goodbyes exchanged. Miss Jemima, in a final act of kindness, offers Miss Sedley some sandwiches and a dictionary for her journey. However, in a surprising turn of events, Miss Sharp throws the dictionary back into the garden as the carriage drives away, leaving Miss Jemima in shock. The passage ends with the closing of the academy gates and the start of a dancing lesson, signifying the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter for Miss Sedley and Miss Sharp.

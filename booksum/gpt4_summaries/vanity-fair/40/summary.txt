The passage begins with the arrival of the heir of Crawley, Pitt, at his family home following a catastrophe. The old Baronet, his father, had survived but was left incapacitated, leaving the management of the estate to Pitt. The estate was in a state of disarray due to the old Baronet's constant buying, mortgaging, and quarreling with business associates, tenants, and lawyers. Pitt, being an orderly and persevering diplomat, took on the task of resolving these issues with great dedication. His entire family moved to Queen's Crawley, including Lady Southdown, who began converting the parish despite the disapproval of Mrs. Bute.

Mrs. Bute's plans for Miss Betsy Horrocks did not materialize, and she and her father left the Hall when he took possession of the Crawley Arms in the village. The Rector and the ex-butler, who had obtained a small freehold, had votes for the borough, along with four others, forming the representative body for Queen's Crawley. There was a semblance of courtesy between the ladies of the Rectory and the Hall, but Mrs. Bute and Lady Southdown often clashed and eventually stopped seeing each other. 

Lady Jane was the favorite of the old Baronet, who was cared for by Miss Hester. The old man was often taken out on the terrace in a chair, where he would nod and smile at Lady Jane. When she left, he would cry, and Hester would scold him. Eventually, the old Baronet passed away, leaving Pitt as the head of the family. Pitt decided to rule justly and honestly, and to be on good terms with all his relatives. He wrote a letter to his brother Rawdon, informing him of their father's death.

Rebecca, Rawdon's wife, was excited about the news and made plans to attend the funeral and to be presented at Court. She also had ambitions for Rawdon to gain a seat in Parliament. They decided to travel by coach to the funeral, leaving their son at home. Rebecca also instructed Rawdon to inform their man, Sparks, about the death of Sir Pitt, as this would console Raggles, who had been pressing for money.

Rebecca then encountered Miss Briggs, an old friend, who had been trying to find work. Rebecca invited Briggs to live with her, and Briggs agreed, despite the warnings of Mrs. Bowls, her landlady. Soon after, Briggs lent Rawdon six hundred pounds upon annuity.

The passage revolves around the struggles and trials of the Osborne family, particularly focusing on the widow Osborne and her son, George. The family, which also includes the widow's parents, is financially supported by a meager income of a hundred pounds a year from the widow and an additional 120 pounds from Jos. Despite their limited means, they manage to live in decent comfort, with the help of a single Irish servant who also serves Mr. Clapp and his wife. Mr. Clapp, a former clerk of Sedley, remains loyal to the family despite their financial decline, defending their honor and refusing to sit before Sedley at the club.

The widow Osborne is depicted as a devoted mother who sacrifices her own needs for her son, George. She spends sleepless nights teaching him lessons from various subjects, including Latin, in hopes of providing him a good education. However, sending him to school is a painful experience for her, as she fears the harshness of the schoolmaster and the roughness of his schoolfellows. Despite her concerns, George enjoys school and shares numerous stories about his schoolmates with his mother.

The family's financial situation worsens over time, with their bills falling into arrear due to delayed remittances from India. The widow Osborne tries to manage the situation by selling her India shawl for twenty guineas, which she uses to buy books for George and pay his half-year's schooling. However, this act of generosity is met with indignation by her mother, who accuses her of wasting money on books while the family is struggling to make ends meet.

The passage ends with the widow Osborne realizing the extent of their financial crisis and the sacrifices she needs to make for her son's future. She is faced with a difficult decision: to let George live with his grandfather in exchange for a decent allowance and a chance at a better life, or to keep him by her side and continue their life of hardship. This realization brings her immense despair and guilt, as she blames herself for their current predicament.

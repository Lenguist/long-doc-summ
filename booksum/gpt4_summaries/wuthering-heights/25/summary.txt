The passage begins with the narrator, Ellen, recovering from an illness and asking Catherine to read to her. Catherine, however, seems reluctant and tries various tactics to avoid the task, including pretending to be tired. Eventually, Catherine leaves, claiming to have a headache. Ellen, suspicious of Catherine's behavior, searches for her in the house but finds no trace. She then spots a figure in the garden, which turns out to be a groom leading Catherine's pony. Catherine returns home, entering through a window, and is surprised when Ellen confronts her.

Catherine confesses to Ellen that she has been secretly visiting Wuthering Heights every day since Ellen fell ill. She explains that she had made arrangements with a servant, Michael, to prepare her pony for these trips. Catherine describes her visits to Wuthering Heights, where she spent time with Linton, who was in high spirits. They would talk, plan for the summer, and occasionally argue. Catherine also mentions a near quarrel with Hareton Earnshaw, whom she treated with contempt.

Ellen interrupts Catherine's narrative, criticizing her for her disrespectful behavior towards Hareton. Catherine dismisses Ellen's concerns and continues her story. She describes a violent encounter with Earnshaw, who physically removed Linton from her presence and locked her out. Catherine was deeply distressed by this incident and threatened to tell her father about Earnshaw's behavior.

Despite the traumatic experience, Catherine continues to visit Wuthering Heights, though her visits are often filled with tension and conflict. She describes Linton as having a distorted nature, causing distress for both himself and his friends. Catherine's father eventually discovers her secret visits and forbids her from going to Wuthering Heights. Despite Catherine's pleas, her father remains firm in his decision, promising only to write to Linton and allow him to visit the Grange.

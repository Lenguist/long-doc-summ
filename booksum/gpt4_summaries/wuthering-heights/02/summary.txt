The passage begins with the narrator describing a cold, misty afternoon. He initially planned to stay indoors, but a dirty room drove him out for a walk. After a four-mile journey, he arrived at Heathcliff's garden gate just as the first snowflakes began to fall. Despite the harsh weather, he attempted to gain entry to the house, but was met with resistance from the servant, Joseph. Eventually, a young man without a coat guided him through a wash-house and a paved area to a warm, cheerful room where he was introduced to Mrs. Heathcliff.

Mrs. Heathcliff, a slender and beautiful woman, seemed cold and unresponsive to the narrator's attempts at conversation. The young man, who was later revealed to be Hareton Earnshaw, was also gruff and uninviting. The narrator found the atmosphere uncomfortable and oppressive, despite the physical comforts of the room. 

The narrator's attempts to engage in conversation were met with hostility and scorn, particularly from Heathcliff. The narrator was initially mistaken about the relationships between the inhabitants of the house, assuming that Mrs. Heathcliff was married to the older man, but it was clarified that she was actually his daughter-in-law. The narrator was also mistaken about Hareton, initially assuming he was a servant due to his rough appearance and manners, but later learning that he was a member of the family.

The narrator's attempts to leave were thwarted by a snowstorm, and Heathcliff refused to provide him with a guide or accommodations. The narrator was forced to stay the night, enduring the hostile environment and the unpleasant company. Despite his discomfort and the inhospitable treatment he received, the narrator was forced to accept the situation due to his physical condition and the harsh weather conditions. The passage ends with the narrator being led to bed by Zillah, the housewife, after being given a glass of brandy by Heathcliff's orders.

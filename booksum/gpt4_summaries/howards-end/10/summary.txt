The passage begins with a reflection on the character of Mrs. Wilcox. The narrator questions whether she is one of those people who offer intimacy only to withdraw it, leaving others feeling used and exhausted. Margaret Schlegel, a Londoner, is eager to establish a friendship with Mrs. Wilcox, but the older woman resists being rushed into the relationship. 

The narrative then shifts to a shopping trip. Mrs. Wilcox invites Margaret to accompany her to buy Christmas presents. Margaret suggests they make a list of people and gifts, and Mrs. Wilcox agrees, though she admits she is not a good shopper. During the shopping trip, Margaret takes charge, deciding on gifts for various recipients. The shopping trip also reveals Margaret's cynical views on Christmas, seeing it as a time of excessive spending and lack of genuine goodwill.

The relationship between the two women is further explored when Mrs. Wilcox invites Margaret to visit her house, Howards End. Margaret initially declines, citing the weather and their fatigue. This refusal seems to upset Mrs. Wilcox, leading to a tense ride home. Margaret later regrets her decision, realizing the significance of the invitation. She decides to accept the invitation after all, but when she goes to inform Mrs. Wilcox, she finds that she has already left.

The passage ends with a surprise encounter at the train station. Mrs. Wilcox's husband and daughter, who were supposed to be in Yorkshire, appear unexpectedly due to a motor accident. The family reunion leaves Margaret feeling unwanted and alone. Mrs. Wilcox, caught up in the excitement of seeing her family, forgets about their planned outing, leaving Margaret alone at the station.

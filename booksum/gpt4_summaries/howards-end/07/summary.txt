The passage begins with Mrs. Munt sharing the news with her niece Margaret that the Wilcox family has moved into the flat opposite theirs. Mrs. Munt is deeply interested in the flats and their inhabitants, despite her outward disdain for them. She is particularly concerned about the potential impact of the Wilcox family's proximity on her other niece, Helen, who had a brief romantic entanglement with Paul Wilcox. 

Margaret, however, is not worried. She believes that Helen's interest in the Wilcoxes has completely died out and that they can maintain a polite, distant relationship with the family. Mrs. Munt disagrees, arguing that the physical proximity will inevitably lead to more interactions. She also expresses her concern about the Wilcoxes' lack of response to an apology letter Margaret sent on Helen's behalf.

The conversation then shifts to a discussion about wealth and its role in their lives. Margaret asserts that money provides a cushion that allows them to avoid unpleasant situations and people. She criticizes those who pretend to be poor and ignore the privileges that wealth brings. She argues that their wealth allows them to navigate relationships and situations in a way that the poor cannot. 

Mrs. Munt is taken aback by Margaret's candidness about the advantages of wealth, but agrees with her. Margaret then asks her aunt to accompany her to the registry office to hire a housemaid. Despite her efforts, she is unable to hire a permanent housemaid and settles for a temporary one. This failure depresses her and she becomes more concerned about the Wilcoxes' presence.

Upon returning home, Margaret decides to discuss the issue with Helen. Helen assures her that she is not bothered by the Wilcoxes' proximity. She admits to being slightly concerned about Mrs. Wilcox's feelings, but not enough to warrant moving away. Helen then reveals that she will be away until after the New Year, which seems to alleviate Margaret's concerns. The passage ends with Helen laughing off Margaret's worries and promising never to fall in love with a Wilcox again.

The passage revolves around the life of a young man named Leonard Bast, who is on the brink of gentility but is poor and struggles with his social status. Leonard is aware of his poverty and is determined not to admit any inferiority to the rich, despite his lack of courtesy, intelligence, health, and lovability compared to them. He yearns for a better life, both physically and mentally, and is constantly seeking to improve his status. He is living in a time where democracy has blurred the lines of social classes, forcing him to pretend to be a gentleman to avoid falling into the abyss of insignificance.

Leonard's life is filled with struggles and pretense. After attending a concert, he walks home, contemplating his encounter with the Miss Schlegels, two cultured women who he feels superior to. He suspects them of being thieves and feels a sense of superiority over them. However, his empty stomach brings him back to reality, reminding him of his poverty.

The story then shifts to Leonard's home, a cheaply constructed flat in Camelia Road, London. The area is undergoing rapid development, with new buildings constantly being erected and old ones demolished. Leonard's flat is small and poorly furnished, with only a few personal items. He lives there with a woman named Jacky, who is past her prime and not respectable. Jacky is dependent on Leonard, constantly seeking reassurance of his love and his promise to marry her when he turns 21.

Leonard is frustrated with Jacky's constant need for reassurance and his own financial struggles. He seeks solace in literature, specifically Ruskin's Stones of Venice, hoping it will help him improve himself and gain a wider outlook on life. He believes that through effort and self-improvement, he can rise above his current circumstances. However, he feels a sense of envy and sadness towards those who are naturally cultured and have easy access to the world of art and literature, a world he feels he can never truly be a part of.

The passage ends with Leonard trying to ignore Jacky's calls from the bedroom, choosing to immerse himself in his book instead. He is caught between his aspiration for a better life and the harsh reality of his current situation.

The passage begins with Drouet, a drummer, in Chicago, paying attention to a secret order he belongs to. He is inspired by a fellow member, Hazenstab, who has gained significant benefits from his membership. Drouet decides to take a more active role in the order and visits his local lodge headquarters. There, he is approached by Mr. Harry Quincel, a prominent member of the order, who asks Drouet to help them find a young lady to participate in a theatrical performance the order is planning to raise funds for new furniture.

Drouet agrees to help, despite not knowing anyone suitable for the role. Quincel explains that the play they are planning to perform is "Under the Gaslight," a popular production. Drouet is familiar with the play and expresses confidence that it will be successful. Quincel reminds Drouet to find a young woman to play the part of Laura before they part ways.

Drouet is reminded of his promise when he receives a letter announcing the first rehearsal and requesting the address of the young lady who will play Laura. He struggles to think of someone suitable for the role, but eventually decides on a woman he knows who lives conveniently on the West Side. However, he forgets about his promise until he sees a notice in the newspaper about the upcoming performance.

Drouet discusses the play with his companion, Carrie, and suggests that she could take the part of Laura. Carrie is initially hesitant, claiming she can't act, but Drouet encourages her, insisting that she is talented and would enjoy the experience. Eventually, Carrie agrees to take the part, and Drouet promises to get her the script.

Drouet visits the lodge again and informs Quincel that he has found a young lady to play Laura. He gives Quincel Carrie's address and stage name, "Carrie Madenda," and promises to deliver her part to her. He also tells Carrie about the name he gave for her, explaining that he didn't want to introduce her as his wife in case she didn't do well in the play.

Carrie studies her part and practices her lines, finding that she enjoys the process. She is surprised by the brevity of her part, but believes she can perform it well. When Drouet visits her again, she performs part of the play for him, impressing him with her talent. He assures her that she will do well in the performance.

The passage ends with Drouet expressing his confidence in Carrie's abilities and assuring her that she won't fail in her performance. Carrie, in turn, is excited and eager to participate in the play, finding joy in the process of preparing for her role.

The passage begins with a detailed description of Gretchen, a diligent and punctual young woman who wakes up early and is always busy in the morning. She lives in Dreiberg, a place where even in midsummer the dawn is chill. She takes care of two goats and serves breakfast to a sick woman who lives on the third floor. The woman pays Gretchen two crowns a week to serve her breakfast, but Gretchen would have done it for free. The woman is seriously ill, but refuses to see a doctor and only accepts Gretchen's care. One morning, the woman gives Gretchen a note to deliver to the princess.

Gretchen is surprised by the task, but accepts it. She dresses up and heads to the palace. At the palace, she encounters a soldier who initially refuses to let her in without a permit. However, when Gretchen mentions that she has come from number forty Krumerweg, the soldier lets her in. Inside the palace gardens, Gretchen is caught by the head gardener who scolds her for entering without a permit. However, the princess intervenes and asks Gretchen to follow her.

The princess reads the note from the sick woman and becomes emotional. She reveals to Gretchen that the woman had taken care of her when she was younger and taught her music. The princess then decides to introduce Gretchen to Herr Ernst, the director of the opera. Gretchen impresses everyone with her singing, including the director who promises to make her a great singer. The princess also grants Gretchen access to the palace gardens whenever she wishes. As Gretchen leaves the palace, she dreams of becoming rich and famous. However, the passage ends with the note that Gretchen never became a prima donna, hinting at a different fate for her.

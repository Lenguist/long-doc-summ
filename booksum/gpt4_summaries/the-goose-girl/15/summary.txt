The passage begins with a conversation between a clock-mender and the owner of a watch, Ludwig. The clock-mender reveals that he was once a wealthy and honorable man, falsely accused of a crime that led to the confiscation of his estates and the death of his wife. He has spent the last 17 or 18 years trying to prove his innocence, traveling and seeking a Gipsy who knows the truth. He has taken up clock-mending, a childhood pastime, as a way to pass the time and stay unnoticed. Ludwig, who believes in the clock-mender's innocence, offers his help, but the clock-mender refuses, preferring to wait for the truth to come out on its own.

The narrative then shifts to Carmichael, who is returning from a ride near the frontier. He encounters a group of riders, including a princess, and they ride together towards the city. The princess reveals that she has declined a marriage proposal from the king of Jugendheit, which is currently a state secret. Carmichael, in turn, reveals his plans to ask for his recall, expressing a desire for action and hinting at a romantic interest that the princess does not fully understand.

On their way back to the city, they encounter a man named Grumbach sitting on a parapet. Carmichael introduces Grumbach to the princess, explaining that they fought together in the American war. The princess shows interest in Grumbach's war experiences and his life in America. As they part ways, the princess drops her locket, which Grumbach retrieves and returns to her. The passage ends with Grumbach watching the riders disappear into the city, his face as livid as the scar on his head.

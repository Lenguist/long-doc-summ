The passage begins with Fanny entering a drawing-room where her uncle and aunts are present. Her uncle admires her elegance and beauty, but only commends her neat dress in her presence. After she leaves the room, he praises her beauty openly. Lady Bertram agrees with him, mentioning that she sent Chapman, presumably a servant or helper, to assist Fanny. Mrs. Norris, another aunt, attributes Fanny's good looks and manners to the advantages of being raised in their family. Sir Thomas, Fanny's uncle, remains silent, but the young men in the room seem to agree with the praise.

Fanny is aware of their approval and it boosts her confidence, making her look even better. She is happy and her happiness increases when Edmund, who is holding the door open for her, asks her to reserve two dances for him at the upcoming ball. This request fills Fanny with joy, as she has rarely experienced such high spirits. She practices her dance steps in the drawing-room, careful to avoid the notice of her aunt Norris, who is busy with the fire.

The passage then describes a period of half an hour that would have been dull under any other circumstances, but Fanny's happiness prevails. She is content with her conversation with Edmund and is indifferent to the restlessness of Mrs. Norris and the yawns of Lady Bertram. When the gentlemen join them, there is a general spirit of ease and enjoyment. Fanny senses a struggle in Edmund's cheerfulness, but appreciates his efforts to maintain a positive atmosphere.

As the guests begin to arrive, Fanny becomes more subdued and self-conscious. She is introduced to various people by her uncle, which she finds difficult. She longs to be with her brother William, who is at ease in the background. The entrance of the Grants and Crawfords eases the stiffness of the gathering and Fanny feels more comfortable. However, she finds it hard to keep her eyes from wandering between Edmund and Mary Crawford.

Fanny's happiness is mixed with discomfort when Mr. Crawford asks her to dance. She is relieved to have a partner, but there is a pointedness in his manner that she does not like. She feels embarrassed and can only relax when he turns his attention to someone else. As the company moves into the ballroom, Fanny finds herself near Miss Crawford, who is also attentive to her. Fanny is anxious and hastens to explain about the second necklace, the real chain. Miss Crawford is delighted and praises Edmund, which makes Fanny feel uncomfortable.

The ball begins and Fanny is partnered with Mr. Crawford. She is frightened and can only enjoy herself when she feels she is no longer being watched. She is praised by many people for her attractiveness, modesty, and connection to Sir Thomas. Sir Thomas himself is proud of his niece and pleased that he has provided her with education and manners.

The passage ends with Sir Thomas advising Fanny to go to bed, perhaps not only for her health but also to separate her from Mr. Crawford, who has been sitting by her for a long time. Fanny leaves the ballroom, taking a last look at the dancing couples, and goes up the staircase, feeling a mix of excitement, fatigue, and delight.

The passage begins with Heyward, a character in the story, being surprised by the sudden flight of his guide and the cries of pursuers. He rushes to join the chase, only to meet three foresters returning from an unsuccessful pursuit. They discuss the likelihood of capturing the fugitive, with the scout expressing doubt and explaining the challenges of tracking in the wilderness. The scout also warns Heyward of the danger of chasing after the fugitive, suggesting that they could be walking into an ambush. 

The group's situation becomes increasingly perilous as they realize they are surrounded by enemies who are waiting for the cover of darkness to attack. Heyward is filled with anxiety and fear, imagining every shadow to be an enemy lurking in the forest. He pleads with his companions to stay and defend those they are escorting, promising to reward them for their efforts. However, his companions seem to be debating a plan of their own. 

The scout eventually agrees to help Heyward and his companions, but on two conditions: they must remain silent and never reveal the location they will be taken to. Heyward agrees, and they quickly move to a new location. The scout then leaves the group to fetch the rest of the party and their provisions. 

When the scout returns, he guides the group to a canoe and they set off down the river. They navigate through treacherous waters, eventually reaching a spot where they can land. The scout then leaves again to fetch the horses and provisions, leaving the group in a state of anxious suspense. 

When the scout returns, they discuss their situation and the potential threat of their enemies finding them. The scout is adamant that they can hold their ground if necessary. He also notes that the horses seemed to sense danger, suggesting that their enemies may be close by. Despite the danger, the group decides to stay put and prepare for a potential attack. 

The passage concludes with the scout and the Mohicans disappearing into the darkness, leaving the rest of the group to wait anxiously for their return. The scene is tense and fraught with danger, as the group is surrounded by potential enemies and must rely on the skill and knowledge of the scout and the Mohicans to survive.

The passage begins with Cora, Alice, Heyward, and Hawkeye being held as prisoners by a tribe of Native Americans, the Delawares. Cora, despite being surrounded by threatening figures, keeps her focus on her sister Alice, who is visibly anxious and scared. Heyward, who is in love with Alice, is also present and concerned for both women. Hawkeye, a scout, is also there, positioned slightly behind them out of respect for their higher social status. Uncas, another key character, is absent.

The Delawares are seeking a man known as "La Longue Carabine". When they ask for him, neither Duncan nor the scout answer. Duncan, however, recognizes Magua, a Huron, among the Delawares and suspects he has a role in their current predicament. He fears that the Delawares intend to punish Hawkeye, who he believes is La Longue Carabine. In an attempt to protect Hawkeye, Duncan claims to be La Longue Carabine himself. However, his claim is challenged by a shooting contest, which Hawkeye wins, proving his identity.

Following the contest, Magua, who is revealed to be the antagonist, steps forward to claim his prisoners. Cora, one of the captives, pleads with the patriarch of the Delawares, Tamenund, for mercy. She reminds him of a past kindness shown to one of his people by a white man, hoping to sway him. However, Tamenund, who is very old and somewhat disconnected from the present, does not remember the event Cora refers to. 

Despite Cora's pleas, Tamenund allows Magua to take his prisoners and leave. Cora, desperate, points out that there is another Delaware who has not been heard from yet. The others refer to this person as a "snake" and a "redskin in the pay of the Yengeese" who they are keeping for torture. Tamenund agrees to hear from this individual, and the passage ends with a tense silence as they wait for this person to be brought forward.

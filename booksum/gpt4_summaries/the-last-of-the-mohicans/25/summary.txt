The passage begins with a conversation between Snug and Quince, characters from Shakespeare's "Midsummer Night's Dream," discussing the role of the lion in their play. The scene then shifts to a more serious and solemn setting, where a beast continues its movements, and a character named Gamut speaks in his native tongue, leaving Duncan puzzled about its hidden meaning. The chief then asks Heyward to perform a ritual to drive away the evil spirit from the sick woman. Heyward, however, is interrupted by a fierce growl from the beast. The chief then leaves Duncan alone with the sick woman and the beast.

The beast then transforms into a scout, who warns Heyward about the presence of enemies. Heyward then discovers that the beast was actually a scout in disguise. The scout advises Heyward to wash off his paint and then leaves to examine the state of the larder. Heyward then finds Alice, who had been prepared for his visit by David. Alice expresses her relief at seeing Heyward and they discuss their situation and their plans to escape.

However, their plans are interrupted by the arrival of Magua, a Huron chief. Heyward and the scout manage to restrain Magua and leave him helpless. They then manage to escape from the cave, with Heyward carrying Alice. The scout advises Heyward to follow a path to the brook and then to the hill where they will find the fires of the other people. The scout then leaves to rescue the last of the Mohicans, who has been captured by the Hurons. Despite pleas from Alice and Heyward, the scout is determined to rescue his friend.

Finally, Heyward and Alice make their way towards the distant village of the Delawares, leaving the scout behind to face the Hurons and rescue the captured Mohican.

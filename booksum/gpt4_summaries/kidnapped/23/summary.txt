The passage describes the narrator's journey to a secluded house known as "Cluny's Cage" located on a steep hillside. The house, made from woven tree trunks and covered with moss, was large enough to accommodate five or six people. It was one of several hiding places used by Cluny, who moved from one location to another based on the movements of soldiers. Despite living in hiding, Cluny maintained a strong influence over his clan, settling disputes and commanding respect.

Upon arrival, the narrator and his companion, Alan, are warmly welcomed by Cluny. Despite his simple attire, Cluny carries himself with the manners of a king. He invites them to dine and play cards, a proposal that the narrator, due to his upbringing, finds distasteful. However, to avoid causing a conflict, he agrees to rest while Alan and Cluny play.

Over the next few days, the narrator falls ill and drifts in and out of consciousness. He observes that Alan initially seems to be winning the card games, but the situation changes on the second day. Alan asks the narrator for a loan, which he gives without understanding the reason. When the narrator recovers, he discovers that Alan has lost all their money.

Cluny, embarrassed by the situation, offers to return the money. The narrator, however, is conflicted about accepting it back, considering it a matter of pride. He seeks Cluny's advice, who, despite his initial irritation, commends the narrator's gentlemanly spirit and advises him to take the money back. The passage ends with Cluny extending his hand in a gesture of reconciliation.

The passage begins with the narrator and his companion, Alan, sailing through the Little Minch, a strait in Scotland. The captain of their ship, lacking a map, decides to navigate around the Isle of Mull due to favorable wind conditions. As they sail, they enjoy the pleasant weather and the sight of the surrounding islands. During this time, the narrator and Alan share their personal stories, with Alan revealing his strong hatred for the Campbells, a rival clan. 

Alan tells the narrator about his father, Duncan Stewart, who was a skilled swordsman and served in the Black Watch, a regiment of the British Army. Duncan was chosen to demonstrate his swordsmanship before King George and Queen Carline. After the demonstration, each swordsman was given three guineas by the King. However, Duncan gave his reward to the palace porter, a gesture that was followed by the other swordsmen. Alan mentions that his father's generosity left him with little wealth, leading him to enlist in the English army. However, he later deserted to the French side during the Battle of Preston Pans.

Alan also shares his reasons for returning to Scotland despite being a condemned rebel and a deserter. He explains that he misses his homeland and has duties to fulfill, such as recruiting men for the French King and collecting rent for his chief, Ardshiel. Alan reveals that the tenants of Ardshiel's lands pay two rents: one to King George and another to Ardshiel, who lives in exile in France. This act of loyalty angers Colin Campbell, also known as the Red Fox, who is the King's factor on Ardshiel's lands. 

The Red Fox attempts to evict the loyal tenants and replace them with others who would not pay Ardshiel. However, the tenants offer a higher price than any Campbell, frustrating the Red Fox's plans. Alan expresses his desire for revenge against the Red Fox for his actions. The narrator, however, advises Alan against seeking revenge, arguing that it would not change the situation. Alan then explains how he manages to evade the troops in the Highlands, attributing his success to the vastness of the landscape and the help of friends. 

The passage concludes with the narrator praising Alan's skills in music, poetry, shooting, fishing, and fencing. He also acknowledges Alan's faults, particularly his tendency to take offense and start quarrels, but notes that Alan has largely refrained from such behavior in his presence.

The passage begins with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson at the Northumberland Hotel, where they are to meet Sir Henry Baskerville. Holmes, displaying his usual keen observational skills, investigates the hotel's register, noting two names added after Baskerville's: Theophilus Johnson and Mrs. Oldmore. After some inquiries with the hotel staff, Holmes deduces that these individuals are keeping a close watch on Baskerville, but are keen to remain unseen by him. 

Upon meeting Baskerville, they find him angry and holding an old boot. He explains that his boots have been disappearing and reappearing, and he suspects foul play at the hotel. Despite the seemingly trivial nature of the problem, Holmes takes it seriously, acknowledging its oddity and potential connection to the larger, more complex case at hand. 

Holmes and Watson then discuss Baskerville's plans to return to Baskerville Hall, with Holmes advising him not to go alone due to the potential dangers he might face. Holmes suggests Watson accompany Baskerville, as he himself is unable to leave London due to other pressing cases. Watson agrees, excited by the prospect of adventure. 

The discussion then turns to the inheritance of Sir Charles Baskerville, which includes a significant sum of money. Holmes expresses surprise at the large amount involved, and they discuss potential heirs and the implications of the inheritance. 

The passage concludes with a visit from a cabman, who was hired by a man claiming to be Sherlock Holmes to follow the real Holmes and Watson. The imposter had successfully tricked the cabman into revealing information about their movements. This revelation leaves Holmes impressed by the cunning of their adversary, and he expresses concern for Watson's safety as he prepares to leave for Devonshire.

The passage opens with Mr. Utterson, a bachelor, coming home to his house in a somber mood and having dinner without any enthusiasm. After dinner, he usually reads by the fire until midnight, but this particular night, he goes into his business room and retrieves a document from his safe. The document is Dr. Jekyll's will, which Mr. Utterson studies with a troubled expression. The will states that in the event of Dr. Jekyll's death or disappearance for more than three months, all his possessions will go to his friend, Edward Hyde. This clause in the will has long been a source of discomfort for Mr. Utterson, who finds it strange and unsettling. 

After reading the will, Mr. Utterson decides to visit his friend, Dr. Lanyon, hoping he might have some insight into the situation. Dr. Lanyon, a robust and cheerful man, greets Mr. Utterson warmly. The two are old friends, having known each other since school. During their conversation, Mr. Utterson brings up the subject of Dr. Jekyll and his will. Dr. Lanyon admits that he has not seen much of Jekyll in recent years, as he believes Jekyll has become too fanciful. Mr. Utterson then asks if Dr. Lanyon has ever met Edward Hyde, to which Lanyon replies that he has not.

Following his visit with Dr. Lanyon, Mr. Utterson becomes obsessed with the idea of meeting Mr. Hyde. He begins to stake out the door in the by-street of shops, hoping to encounter him. One night, his patience is rewarded when he spots a small, plainly dressed man approaching the door. Mr. Utterson identifies himself and asks to see Hyde's face. Hyde reluctantly shows his face, leaving Mr. Utterson with a strong sense of disgust and fear. Despite his revulsion, Mr. Utterson is determined to understand the connection between Jekyll and Hyde.

Mr. Utterson then visits Dr. Jekyll's house, where he is informed by the servant, Poole, that Jekyll is not at home but Hyde has a key and comes and goes as he pleases. This information further deepens Mr. Utterson's concern for his friend, Dr. Jekyll. He worries that Jekyll is in trouble and that Hyde may be a threat to him, especially if he becomes aware of the will. Mr. Utterson resolves to do everything he can to help Jekyll, if only Jekyll will let him.

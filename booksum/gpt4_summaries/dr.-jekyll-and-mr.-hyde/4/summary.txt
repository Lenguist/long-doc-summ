In October of an unspecified year, London was shocked by a brutal crime that gained notoriety due to the high social standing of the victim. The crime was witnessed by a maid who lived alone in a house near the river. The maid, who was daydreaming by her window on a clear, moonlit night, saw an elderly and distinguished gentleman walking down the lane. He was approached by a smaller man, whom the maid recognized as Mr. Hyde, a man who had previously visited her employer and whom she disliked.

The elderly gentleman seemed to be politely conversing with Hyde, perhaps asking for directions. However, Hyde suddenly erupted in anger, brandishing a heavy cane and violently attacking the older man. The maid described Hyde's behavior as mad, and his attack was so ferocious that the victim's bones could be heard shattering. The sight and sounds of the attack caused the maid to faint.

When the maid regained consciousness around two in the morning, she called for the police. The murderer had fled, but the victim's horribly mutilated body remained in the lane. The cane used in the attack was found broken nearby, with one half in the gutter and the other presumably taken by Hyde. The victim's purse and gold watch were found on his person, along with a sealed envelope addressed to Mr. Utterson. The envelope was delivered to Utterson the next morning, who recognized the victim as Sir Danvers Carew.

Utterson, upon seeing the broken cane, recognized it as one he had gifted to Henry Jekyll years ago. He then led Inspector Newcomen to Hyde's residence, a dingy street in Soho. The housekeeper, an elderly woman with a hypocritically smooth face, informed them that Hyde had been home late the previous night but had left within an hour. She also mentioned that Hyde's habits were irregular and he was often absent.

Utterson and Newcomen proceeded to search Hyde's rooms, which were luxuriously furnished but showed signs of having been recently and hastily ransacked. They found the other half of the broken cane and a partially burnt cheque-book, leading them to believe that Hyde was the murderer. A visit to the bank revealed that Hyde had several thousand pounds in his account. The police decided to wait for Hyde at the bank and distribute handbills, although they acknowledged that few people knew Hyde well and his appearance was difficult to describe.

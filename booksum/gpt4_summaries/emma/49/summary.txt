Their initial conversation is awkward and constrained, with Emma noticing that Mr. Knightley seems less cheerful than usual. She fears that he might be upset about a conversation he had with his brother.

As they walk together, Emma becomes increasingly anxious, suspecting that Mr. Knightley might want to discuss his feelings for Harriet. She is uncomfortable with the idea and decides that he must initiate the conversation himself. However, the silence between them is unbearable for her. She attempts to break the silence by sharing some surprising news about a wedding. Mr. Knightley reveals that he is already aware of the wedding between Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, which surprises Emma.

Mr. Knightley listens to Emma in silence, causing her to feel uneasy. She continues to explain her actions, admitting her vanity and foolishness. She insists that she was never attached to Frank Churchill and that she now understands his true intentions. She hopes that Mr. Knightley will understand her actions, but he remains silent, deep in thought. Finally, he expresses his low opinion of Frank Churchill but hopes that he might turn out well for the sake of Jane Fairfax, whom he believes to be sincerely attached to Frank Churchill.

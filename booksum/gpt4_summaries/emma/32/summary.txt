The passage begins with the introduction of Mrs. Elton, a new bride, at church. Emma, a main character in the story, is determined to pay her respects to Mrs. Elton promptly and brings along her friend Harriet. Emma finds it difficult to be in the same room as Mrs. Elton due to past events, and Harriet also seems to be uncomfortable. Emma refrains from forming a strong opinion about Mrs. Elton during their visit, describing her as "elegantly dressed, and very pleasing."

Emma, however, suspects that Mrs. Elton lacks elegance and is too at ease for a young bride. She finds her features and mannerisms lacking refinement. As for Mr. Elton, Emma refrains from commenting on his manners, acknowledging the awkwardness of receiving wedding visits. She sympathizes with Mr. Elton for being in the same room with his new wife, the woman he wanted to marry, and the woman he was expected to marry.

After leaving the Eltons' house, Harriet and Emma discuss their impressions of Mrs. Elton. Harriet finds her beautiful and is not surprised that Mr. Elton fell in love with her. Emma agrees that Mrs. Elton is pleasing and well-dressed but suggests that she may have married Mr. Elton for his fortune. Harriet, however, believes Mrs. Elton was genuinely in love with Mr. Elton.

Upon a return visit, Emma has a chance to converse with Mrs. Elton and concludes that she is a vain and ignorant woman, who thinks highly of herself. Emma believes that Harriet would have been a better match for Mr. Elton. Mrs. Elton, during the visit, compares Emma's home, Hartfield, to her brother's estate, Maple Grove, and talks about her plans to explore the area with her brother and sister when they visit.

Mrs. Elton also suggests that she and Emma should form a musical club, to which Emma reacts with disbelief. Mrs. Elton continues to talk about her love for music and her fear that married women often give up their musical pursuits. Emma, however, believes that Mrs. Elton's passion for music will prevent her from doing so.

The passage ends with Emma's father expressing regret for not paying his respects to the Eltons sooner. Emma reassures him that his apologies were likely accepted, but her father insists that it is a matter of politeness and good breeding to pay respects to a bride. Emma disagrees, arguing that such actions encourage people to marry. The conversation leaves her father confused and Emma returns to her thoughts about Mrs. Elton's offenses.

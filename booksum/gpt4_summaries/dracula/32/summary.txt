The passage is a series of letters and diary entries from the characters Mina, Lucy, Dr. Seward, Quincey P. Morris, and Arthur Holmwood. 

In the first letter, Mina writes to Lucy about her busy life as an assistant schoolmistress and her longing to be with Lucy by the sea. She mentions her dedication to learning shorthand to assist her fianc√©, Jonathan, in his work. She also mentions that she has received a letter from Jonathan who is currently in Transylvania and will be returning in a week. 

Lucy responds to Mina's letter, defending herself against Mina's accusation of being a bad correspondent. She mentions her social activities in town and a certain tall, curly-haired man, Mr. Holmwood, who often visits. She also mentions another man, a doctor who runs a lunatic asylum, whom she thinks would be a good match for Mina if she weren't already engaged. 

In another letter, Lucy tells Mina about receiving three marriage proposals in one day. The first proposal is from Dr. John Seward, the man she previously mentioned. She rejects him, causing him to leave heartbroken. The second proposal is from Quincey P. Morris, an American from Texas. She also rejects him, but he takes it well and they part as friends. The third proposal, which she accepts, is implied to be from Arthur Holmwood, the man she mentioned in her previous letter. 

Dr. Seward's diary entry reveals his feelings of emptiness following Lucy's rejection. He distracts himself with work, particularly focusing on a patient named R. M. Renfield who he finds interesting. 

Quincey P. Morris sends a letter to Arthur Holmwood, inviting him to a gathering where they can share stories and drink to Arthur's happiness, hinting that he knows about Arthur's successful proposal to Lucy. Arthur responds with a telegram, accepting the invitation and hinting that he has exciting news to share.

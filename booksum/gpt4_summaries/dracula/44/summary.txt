Upon arrival at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing receives a telegram from Mina Harker stating that she is on her way with important news. Van Helsing instructs his friend John to meet Mina at the station and prepare a room for her at his house. Van Helsing then gives John a copy of Jonathan Harker's diary and Mrs. Harker's diary, instructing him to study them carefully as they contain valuable information about their mission. Van Helsing departs, leaving John to meet Mina.

When Mina arrives, she and John travel to his house, which is a lunatic asylum. Mina is initially unnerved by the location but agrees to discuss important matters with John in his study. John is eager to read the documents left by Van Helsing but needs to distract Mina to do so. 

In her journal, Mina describes her surprise at finding John alone in his study, talking to a phonograph, which he uses to record his diary. Intrigued, she asks to hear it, but John hesitates, fearing the contents might upset her. However, Mina convinces him to let her transcribe his diary, believing it may provide valuable insight into their situation. 

John's diary entry reveals his absorption in the Harkers' diaries and his concern for Mina's emotional state. He is surprised by Jonathan Harker's calm demeanor despite the dangerous circumstances. Mina and Jonathan work diligently to organize all the documents related to their mission. 

Mina expresses her relief at Jonathan's resilience and her excitement about their progress. She is deeply moved by the tragic story of Lucy's death and the evil they are facing. She meets with Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris, who are unaware of her knowledge about their proposals to Lucy. Mina decides to inform them about the current situation and gives them copies of the organized documents. 

Mina comforts a grieving Lord Godalming, offering her sympathy and friendship. She promises to help him if he ever needs it in the future. She also extends her friendship to Mr. Morris, offering him comfort and support. Both men are deeply touched by her kindness and pledge their gratitude and assistance to her.

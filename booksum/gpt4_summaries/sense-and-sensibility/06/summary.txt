The passage begins by describing the journey of a group of travelers who are moving to a new home in Barton Valley. Initially, the journey is marked by a melancholy mood, but as they approach their destination, their spirits are lifted by the sight of the fertile, well-wooded landscape. They reach their new home, Barton Cottage, which is small but comfortable. The house is surrounded by a green court and a neat wicket gate. The cottage, while not perfect, is in good repair and has a regular structure with a tiled roof. It has a narrow passage leading to the garden, two sitting rooms, four bedrooms, two garrets, and other offices. The travelers are cheered by the joy of the servants upon their arrival and resolve to appear happy for each other's sake.

The location of the house is described as being in a good spot, with high hills rising behind it and a village nearby. The front of the house offers a view of the entire valley and the surrounding countryside. The house's size and furniture are satisfactory to Mrs. Dashwood, who plans to make improvements to the house when she has the funds in the spring. She envisions throwing the passage into one of the sitting rooms and adding a new drawing room and a bedroom. Despite the house's small size, the family is content and begins to settle in, arranging their possessions and making the house feel like a home.

The next day, their landlord, Sir John Middleton, visits to welcome them and offer any necessary accommodations. He is described as a good-looking, good-humored man who expresses genuine satisfaction at their arrival and concern for their comfort. He insists on inviting them to dine at Barton Park every day until they are better settled and sends them gifts of garden produce and game. He also offers to handle their mail and send them his newspaper daily. 

Lady Middleton, Sir John's wife, also visits the Dashwoods. She is described as elegant, handsome, and graceful, but also reserved and cold. She brings along their eldest child, a six-year-old boy, who becomes a topic of conversation. Despite her cold demeanor, the Dashwoods are eager to get to know her better, as their comfort at Barton depends on her. The passage ends with Sir John securing a promise from the Dashwoods to dine at the park the next day.

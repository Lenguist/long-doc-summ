The passage begins with Mrs. Dashwood and two of her daughters visiting Lady Middleton, while Marianne stays at home. Mrs. Dashwood assumes that Marianne's decision to stay behind is due to a promise from Willoughby to visit her. Upon their return, they find Willoughby's carriage and servant waiting, confirming Mrs. Dashwood's suspicion. However, they are surprised to find Marianne in distress, and Willoughby in a state of disappointment. He informs them that he has been sent on business to London by Mrs. Smith, a wealthy relative, and must leave immediately. 

The Dashwoods are taken aback by this sudden departure, especially as Willoughby seems reluctant to accept an invitation to return. Elinor, in particular, is disturbed by his behavior, fearing that there may have been a quarrel between him and Marianne, or that he may not be as committed to their relationship as they had thought. Despite her concerns, she also feels compassion for Marianne, who is clearly heartbroken.

Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then discuss the situation, with Mrs. Dashwood defending Willoughby and suggesting that his sudden departure is due to Mrs. Smith's disapproval of his relationship with Marianne. Elinor, however, remains skeptical, pointing out that neither Willoughby nor Marianne have spoken of any engagement. Mrs. Dashwood insists that their affection for each other is clear, and that Willoughby's behavior can be explained by his need to appease Mrs. Smith.

The conversation is interrupted by the entrance of Margaret, giving Elinor time to reflect on her mother's arguments. She acknowledges the possibility of their validity, but remains uneasy. Marianne joins them for dinner, but is visibly upset and leaves the room in tears. Her distress continues throughout the evening, and any mention of Willoughby causes her great pain. Despite their attempts to comfort her, her family struggles to avoid topics that remind her of him.

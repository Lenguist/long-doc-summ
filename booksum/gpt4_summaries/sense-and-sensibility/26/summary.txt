The passage begins with Elinor embarking on a journey to London under the protection of Mrs. Jennings. Despite their short acquaintance and difference in age and disposition, Elinor is grateful for the companionship. She is also filled with anticipation about the intentions of Willoughby, who is likely already in town. Elinor is determined to gain insight into his character and intentions towards her sister, Marianne. If her observations are unfavorable, she resolves to enlighten her sister; if they are favorable, she will strive to suppress any selfish comparisons or regrets that might diminish her satisfaction in Marianne's happiness.

During their three-day journey, Marianne's behavior indicates what her future relationship with Mrs. Jennings might be like. She is mostly silent, lost in her own thoughts, and only speaks when moved by the beauty of the landscape. To compensate for Marianne's silence, Elinor takes on the role of being polite and attentive to Mrs. Jennings. They reach London on the third day and are given a comfortable apartment in a handsome house. Elinor and Marianne both decide to write letters, with Marianne hastily dismissing Elinor's suggestion to write to their mother. Elinor concludes that Marianne must be writing to Willoughby, which leads her to believe that they are engaged.

Marianne's high spirits continue, but her anxious anticipation of Willoughby's arrival is evident. When a knock at the door turns out to be Colonel Brandon instead of Willoughby, Marianne is so shocked that she leaves the room. Elinor is also disappointed, but she welcomes the Colonel out of respect for him. She is hurt that he can see her disappointment and is concerned about Marianne's behavior. The Colonel asks if Marianne is ill, and Elinor attributes her sister's behavior to headaches and fatigue.

The next morning, Marianne appears to have recovered her spirits and is looking forward to the day's events. Mrs. Palmer arrives, and they all decide to go shopping. Marianne is constantly on the lookout, especially in Bond Street, where they have a lot of business. She is restless and dissatisfied, showing no interest in anything and impatient to return home. They return home late in the morning, and Marianne is disappointed to find that Willoughby has not been there. Elinor is concerned about the mysterious nature of Marianne's engagement and resolves to discuss it with their mother if the situation does not improve.

The passage ends with a dinner at their house, attended by Mrs. Palmer and two of Mrs. Jennings's friends. After dinner, Elinor helps set up a game of whist, while Marianne spends the evening anxiously waiting for Willoughby's arrival. She tries to read but soon gives up, preferring to pace the room and frequently check the window for any sign of Willoughby.

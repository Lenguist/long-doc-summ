The passage revolves around a conversation between Sir Claude, Mrs. Wix, and Maisie. Mrs. Wix reveals that she had a visit from Sir Claude's wife, who had seen them at Folkestone. Mrs. Wix expresses surprise at the kindness shown to her by Sir Claude's wife, who gave her a ten-pound note. Sir Claude, though initially silent, eventually laughs at this revelation. Mrs. Wix then discloses that Sir Claude's wife wants her to take care of Maisie, to which Maisie responds positively.

The conversation takes a turn when Mrs. Wix criticizes Sir Claude's wife's decision to leave Maisie in Sir Claude's care, considering him an indecent person. However, she quickly clarifies that her criticism is not directed at Sir Claude, but at another person, presumably Mrs. Beale. Mrs. Wix further explains that Sir Claude's wife visited her because she wanted a "decent" person to take care of Maisie, implying that she herself was not fit for the role.

Towards the end of the conversation, Sir Claude, despite being criticized by Mrs. Wix, defends Mrs. Beale, stating that she has her own merits. He then leaves the room, admitting to being afraid of Mrs. Beale. This admission reminds Maisie of Sir Claude's previous confession of being afraid of her mother, making Mrs. Beale the second woman he fears. The passage ends with Maisie feeling a deeper tenderness for Sir Claude, understanding his fear of the women in his life.

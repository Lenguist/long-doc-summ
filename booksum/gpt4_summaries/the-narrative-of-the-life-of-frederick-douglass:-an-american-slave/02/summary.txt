The passage describes the author's experiences as a slave on the plantation of Colonel Edward Lloyd, where he lived in the household of his master, who was the clerk and superintendent of the plantation. The plantation, located twelve miles north of Easton in Talbot county, produced tobacco, corn, and wheat in abundance. The plantation also had a sloop, named Sally Lloyd, which was used to transport the produce to market in Baltimore. The sloop was manned by slaves who were highly esteemed by their fellow slaves. 

Colonel Lloyd owned three to four hundred slaves on his home plantation and more on neighboring farms. The overseers of these farms received direction from the managers of the home plantation, which was the seat of government for all the farms. Slaves who were convicted of any high misdemeanor or showed signs of rebellion were severely punished and sold off to slave traders in Baltimore. The slaves received their monthly food allowance and yearly clothing at the home plantation. The author describes the living conditions of the slaves, noting that they slept on the cold, damp floor and worked long hours with little time for rest.

The author describes Mr. Severe, the overseer, as a cruel and profane man who took pleasure in whipping the slaves. After Mr. Severe's death, he was replaced by Mr. Hopkins, who was less cruel and took no pleasure in whipping the slaves. The author describes the home plantation as a bustling place where all the mechanical operations for all the farms were performed. The slaves regarded being selected to do errands at the Great House Farm as a high privilege.

The slaves who were selected to go to the Great House Farm to collect the monthly allowance for themselves and their fellow slaves would sing songs that expressed both their joy and their deep sadness. The author notes that he did not understand the deep meaning of these songs as a slave but now recognizes them as expressions of the slaves' anguish and prayers for deliverance from their chains. He criticizes those who interpret the singing of slaves as evidence of their contentment and happiness, arguing that slaves sing most when they are most unhappy. He concludes by comparing the singing of a slave to the singing of a man cast away on a desolate island, both of which are prompted by the same emotion.

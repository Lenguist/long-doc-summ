After the short visit Emma is sure she does not like Mrs. Elton, as she is not elegant. Harriet says that she thinks she will not mind seeing Mr. and Mrs. Elton together as she thinks Mrs. Elton is charming. When Mrs. Elton returns Emma's visit, Emma is even more convinced that she does not like her. She thinks that she is vain and satisfied with herself. She could not talk enough of her brother-in-law, Mr. Suckling, and his home, Maple Grove, as this is the high pride of her life. She goes on and on about Maple Grove, and about how her sister and brother-in-law will be visiting. Mrs. Elton also suggests that Emma go to Bath, and that she could give her introductions to the society there. The idea that she would be indebted to Mrs. Elton for introductions is almost more than Emma can bear. Mrs. Elton then suggests that she and Emma start a musical society in Highbury, and Emma tries to change the subject. Emma is also offended that Mrs. Elton says she is surprised at Mrs. Weston's being a gentlewoman when she was Emma's governess and that she calls Mr. Knightley just 'Knightley. After Mrs. Elton has gone, Emma thinks much about her offences", "analysis": ""}

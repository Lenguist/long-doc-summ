{"name": "Chapter 14", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820041120/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmDracula21.asp", "summary": "Minas journal continues to note. Jonathan is in a poor state of mind. Van Helsing writes a letter asking Mina to meet him regarding Lucy. She meets him and then tells about Jonathan tale and gives him Jonathans diary. Van Helsing writes back that whatever Jonathan has seen is true. Jonathan is rejuvenated. Dr. Seward still has no suspicion how Lucy died. Van Helsing explains to him again about vampires and how Lucy made the pinpoint mark on the children.", "analysis": "Notes Dr. Seward still cannot make out how Lucy died. Van Helsing has given him immense clues yet Dr. Seward refuses to take it. It is very strange that a man who is such a keen observer still cannot see the facts so close to him. This is an essential part of his character. Jonathan is a new man. He realizes he is not a sick man. What he has seen were not dreams but reality and Van Helsing believes him. This chapter shows Van Helsing and Dr. Seward's characters in contrast."}

During the day, they fish and practice sword-fighting. Alan decides to send a message to James of the Glens to ask him for money to enable them to travel to their destinations. He borrows his button from David, strings it onto a strip of fabric from his coat, and joins it to a cross that he makes from birch and fir twigs. He plans to wait until it is dark, walk to the house of a friend called John Breck Maccoll, and place the cross in his window as a secret signal. Maccoll will see the button and know that Alan is \"in the heather \" and needs help. The birch and fir twigs will tell Maccoll that Alan is in a wood of those trees, and this will lead him to Corrynakeigh. Alan carries out his plan and the next day, Maccoll arrives. Alan gives him a note to take to James of the Glens, asking for money. Three days later, Maccoll comes back with the news that King George's soldiers are everywhere, and that James of the Glens is in prison, under suspicion of complicity in Campbell's murder. Maccoll brings a note from James's wife, begging Alan not to allow himself to be captured. If he is caught, he and James will be executed. She encloses what little money she has raised and a \"Wanted\" poster featuring Alan and David. David is pleased to see that the description of him on the poster focuses on the clothes he has discarded. He thinks that if he were to separate from Alan, he would be safe from arrest, but if he were found with Alan, his case would be serious. But Alan is under the impression that he is David's protector, and David says nothing about parting", "analysis": ""}

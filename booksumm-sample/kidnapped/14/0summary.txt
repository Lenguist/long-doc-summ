The theme of man versus nature will be further explored as we progress. As we have discussed previously, David's adventures are symbolically a rite of passage in his move toward adulthood. We were instantly clued into this theme when the book began with David's departure from home after the death of his parents. After David's journey to his uncle's home, his next major journey takes place on the ship, the Covenant. He is meant to be sold as a slave when the ship reaches America, but with David's good luck, the ship never leaves the waters surrounding Scotland. Life on board the ship, slowly and progressively becomes clearer to David. As he nears each obstacle, the obstacle becomes clearer and dissolves, symbolizing the challenges along the rite of passage to adulthood which one must overcome. David and Alan have successfully fended off the ship's crew and gained control of the brig. To symbolize the peace, the sun comes out. However, soon the normal waters begin spurting up in fountains, identifying that reefs lie around the ship. David is not ready for this obstacle. He does very little to help, is mostly tossed around, and finally is thrown completely overboard and washes away. Metaphorically, David has a good deal of work still to do. The reefs are a wake up call, separating David from the ship, which had been a womb of sorts and given him new confidence, and reducing him to a state where he must rely solely on himself and nature", "analysis": ""}

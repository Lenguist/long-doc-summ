The Doctor assembles an army and he and Rory infiltrate the asteroid base Demon's Run, 
where Amy is held captive and her newborn child, Melody Pond, has been taken by the Eye Patch Lady, Madame Kovarian. 
River Song refuses to join the Doctor, explaining that she cannot be there until the end, when he discovers her identity. 
The Doctor and Rory secure the base, free Amy, and take back Melody. 
The Doctor's allies discover that Melody contains both human and Time Lord DNA,
 a result of her being conceived on the TARDIS on Amy and Rory's wedding night. 
 As Rory and the rest of the Doctor's allies battle the Headless Monks , 
 the Doctor learns that he has been tricked: Melody has been replaced by a Ganger duplicate, 
 and he is too late. River Song arrives communicates her identity to the Doctor and he races off in the TARDIS, 
 promising Amy and Rory that he will get their daughter back. 
 River then informs the couple that she is in fact their daughter;
  "River Song" is a translation of "Melody Pond" in the language of the Gamma Forest.

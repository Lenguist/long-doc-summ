RECAP INCLUDING SCENES OF THE LITTLE GIRL AND EYE-PATCH LADY, CULMINATING IN THE FINAL SCENES OF "THE ALMOST PEOPLE" SPACE An asteroid has been converted to a base known as Demon's Run. INT. DEMON'S RUN, NURSERY A small baby is cooing as it lies in a small crib. As the camera pans to the side, we see the name: Melody Pond. We see a woman's hands caressing the baby as she speaks. AMY: I wish I could tell you that you'll be loved. That you'll be safe and cared for and protected. But this isn't a time for lies. (picks up MELODY) What you are going to be, Melody... We see the EYE-PATCH LADY and a number of armed soldiers standing behind AMY. AMY: ...is very, very brave. EYE-PATCH LADY: Two minutes. AMY: But not as brave as they'll have to be. Because there's someone coming. I don't know where he is, or what he's doing, but trust me. He's on his way. SPACE 20,000 LIGHT YEARS AWAY INT. CYBER-SHIP, CORRIDORS As Cybermen march along a corridor, we see a figure walk past in the shadows, a cloak billowing behind him. We then see the sonic screwdriver used on a door lock. The door slides closed keeping out other Cybermen. INT. CYBER-SHIP, CONTROL The CYBERLEADER and two other Cybermen are monitoring the ship. CYBERMAN: Intruder. Level nine. Seal level nine. The ship rocks as small explosions go off. INT. DEMON'S RUN, NURSERY AMY: There's a man who's never going to let us down. AMY looks out a window and sees a large army gathering outside. AMY: And not even an army can get in the way. The EYE-PATCH LADY walks towards AMY, arms out. Two soldiers walk close behind. AMY: Leave her, just you leave her. Please leave her! Leave her! A YOUNG FEMALE SOLDIER watches as AMY sobs as her daughter is taken away. By the door, two hooded monks step closer to the rail. INT. CYBER-SHIP, CONTROL The ship is rocked by explosions. CYBERMAN: Intruder, level 11. CYBERLEADER: Seal levels 12, 13 and 14. CYBERMAN: Intruder, level 15. INT. DEMON'S RUN, NURSERY MELODY is in her bassinett. AMY leans over her. AMY: He's the last of his kind. He looks young, but he's lived for hundreds and hundreds of years. And wherever they take you, Melody, however scared you are, I promise you, you will never be alone. (leans over and kisses MELODY on the forehead) Because this man is your father. INT. CYBER-SHIP, CONTROL The CYBERLEADER takes position, flanked by other CYBERMEN. CYBERLEADER: Prepare to engage. INT. DEMON'S RUN, NURSERY AMY: He has a name, but the people of our world know him better... INT. CYBER-SHIP, CONTROL The doors slide open and RORY strides in wearing his Roman garb. The CYBERMEN aim their weapons at him. AMY: (V.O.) ..as the Last Centurion. RORY: I have a message and a question. A message from the Doctor and a question from me. Where is my wife? Oh, don't give me those blank looks. The 12th Cyber Legion monitors this entire quadrant. (walks to window where the rest of the fleet can be seen) You hear everything. So you tell me what I need to know, you tell me now, and I'll be on my way. CYBERLEADER: What is the Doctor's message? The ships outside the window explode. RORY remains impassive. RORY: Would you like me to repeat the question? [SCENE_BREAK] Matt Smith Karen Gillan Arthur Darvil "A Good Man Goes to War" by Steven Moffat Producer Marcus Wilson Director Peter Hoar [SCENE_BREAK] INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR We see a ship come in for a landing and then pan down to all the mechanics and engineers. Two are walking toward the lift. One is short and fat, the other tall and skinny. FAT MAN: A whole Cyber legion though. He just blew them all up. To make a point! THIN MAN: We're being paid to fight him, not praise him. Praising costs way more! They step into the lift, passing two monks. FAT MAN: Level Minus 23. Transept. The door slides closed. INT. DEMON'S RUN, LEVEL MINUS 23 They step out of the lift. FAT MAN: Digger says he once chased the Atraxi off a planet, then called them back for a scolding. THIN MAN: Fight him. Not praise him. They pass the YOUNG FEMALE SOLDIER who had been in the nursery. She is sewing something, a knowing smile on her face. ANNOUNCEMENT: Reminder. This base is on Yellow Alert. This base is on Yellow Alert. INT. DEMON'S RUN, COMMUNICATION Two soldiers are watching the monitors and see the YOUNG FEMALE SOLDIER. SOLDIER 1: Is she sewing? SOLDIER 2: She's on a break she can do what she likes. SOLDIER 2 faces SOLDIER 1, holding up two pieces of paper in his hands. One is blank. SOLDIER 2: Now try again. SOLDIER 1: (points at the blank) That one. SOLDIER 2: No, that's the psychic. You've got to look for the fractals. SOLDIER 1 rolls his eyes. SOLDIER 2: Don't look bored, we're on Yellow Alert. SOLDIER 1: We've been on Yellow Alert for three weeks! INT. DEMON'S RUN, LEVEL MINUS 23 Two of the monks walk along, hands clasped in front of them. ANNOUNCEMENT: Reminder: do not interact with headless monks without designed permission. Do not interact with headless monks without designed permission. The FAT MAN and THIN MAN pass by the monks as they take readings off a machine. The THIN MAN watches them. FAT MAN: You're not supposed to stare at them. And if they think you're tying to see under their hoods, they'll kill you on the spot. THIN MAN: But why are they called the Headless Monks? They can't really be headless? YOUNG FEMALE SOLDIER: They believe the domain of faith is the heart, and the domain of doubt is the head. They follow their hearts...that's all. THIN MAN: You're Lorna Bucket, aren't you? LORNA: Yeah. Hello! THIN MAN: I'm the thin one, this is my husband he's the fat one. LORNA: Don't you have names? FAT MAN: We're the thin, fat, gay, married, Anglican marines. Why would we need names as well? (sees monks standing behind LORNA) Oh! Looks like I'm off! Time for my conversion tutorial. See you in a bit. (leaves with monks) Do you lot have Lent?! Cos I'm not good at giving things up... LORNA shakes her head. The THIN MAN looks at her. THIN MAN: Lorna Bucket. You've had an Encounter, haven't you? You've met him. LORNA: I was just a kid. (continues working) THIN MAN: But what's he like? The Doctor. LORNA: He said "run". THIN MAN: Just "run"? LORNA: He said it a lot. THIN MAN: And this was in the Gamma Forests, yeah? Because you're a Gamma girl, aren't you? What are you doing here? The forests are heaven-neutral. LORNA: Yeah, and 30 seconds of The Doctor is the only thing that ever happened there. INT. DEMON'S RUN, MONKS' CHAPEL FAT MAN precedes the monks into the room which is cast in an eerie red glow. FAT MAN: Oh, this is nice, I like this. I mean, quite a lot of red. I hope it's not to hide the stains! One of the monks goes to a shelf containing medium boxes. FAT MAN: What's in the little boxes? As the monk walks forward with the box, a recording plays. RECORDING: Welcome, applicant to the order of the Headless. It is traditional for visiting armies of other faiths to offer individuals for conversion to our order. You have been selected. The monk passes the box to another who opens it and then holds the empty box in front of the FAT MAN. RECORDING: Are you ready to make a donation? INT. DEMON'S RUN, LEVEL MINUS 23 THIN MAN slides a panel closed. It sounds like a guillotine. THIN MAN: So, what do you think? If the Doctor's really coming here, where is he? LORNA: He's the Doctor. He could be anywhere in time and space. She loosens a hose and steam escapes. EXT. LONDON ALLEY, NIGHT, 1888 A hansom pulls to a halt and the passenger exits. WOMAN: Thank you, Parker. I won't be needing you again tonight. PARKER: Yes, my lady. INT. HOUSE, FRONT HALL, NIGHT, 1888 The hooded WOMAN enters her home and a maid greets her. MAID: You're back early, ma'am. Another case cracked, I assume? The WOMAN places a sword reverently on a rack with others. WOMAN: Send a telegram to Inspector Abberline of the Yard. Jack the Ripper has claimed his last victim. MAID: How did you find him? The WOMAN lowers her hood to reveal she is SILURIAN. SILURIAN: Stringy, but tasty all the same. I shan't be needing dinner. MAID: Congratulations, ma'am.(hesitates) However, a matter has arisen in the drawing room. INT. HOUSE, DRAWING ROOM, NIGHT, 1888 The SILURIAN enters, followed by the maid. MAID: It just appeared. What does it mean? The SILURIAN walks forward, taking off her coat. SILURIAN: It means a very old debt is to be repaid. The TARDIS is in the room. SILURIAN: Pack the cases, Jenny. And we're going to need the swords. EXT. THE BATTLE OF ZARUTHSTRA, 4037 An OFFICER is dodging laser fire and explosions as he runs toward the field hospital. OFFICER: Nurse?! Nurse! INT. FIELD HOSPITAL, THE BATTLE OF ZARUTHSTRA, 4037 The OFFICER runs inside. OFFICER: Damn it! Where's the nurse?! WOMAN: He needs help! OFFICER: Madame President, I'm sorry, but we have to go now! Those things could be here any second! On one of the beds we see a YOUNG BOY, most likely MADAME PRESEIDENT'S son. A SONTARAN enters the hospital and removes his helmet. SONTARAN: Did somebody call for a nurse? The SONTARAN scans the YOUNG BOY. YOUNG BOY: Will I be OK? SONTARAN: Of course you will, my boy. You'll be up and around in no time! And perhaps one day you and I shall meet on the field of battle, and I will destroy you for the glory of the Sontaran Empire. YOUNG BOY: Thanks, Nurse. EXT. THE BATTLE OF ZARUTHSTRA, 4037 The SONTARAN leaves the hospital followed by the OFFICER. OFFICER: Commander Strax. I just have to ask. A Sontaran nurse? STRAX: I serve a penance to restore the honour of my clone batch. It is the greatest punishment a Sontaran can endure, to help the weak and sick. OFFICER: Who came up with that one? We hear the TARDIS materialize. STRAX: Tonight, though, perhaps my penance is over. Turns to OFFICER) Captain Harcourt, I hope some day to meet you in the glory of battle, when I shall crush the life from your worthless human form. The two nod their heads in acknowledgment. INT. STORMCAGE, CORRIDOR RIVER sways as she walks up to the phone amidst the blaring alarms. She is wearing a late (?) Victorian gown. RIVER: (into phone) Oh, turn it off. I'm breaking in, not out. This is River Song, back in her cell... Oh, and I'll take breakfast at the usual time. Thank you! RIVER hangs up the phone and glides along the floor. She stops when she sees a silhouette dressed as a Roman. RIVER: Oh, are you boys dressing up as Romans now? I thought nobody read my memos. RORY moves forward out of the shadows. RORY: Dr Song? It's Rory. Sorry, have we met yet? Time streams, I'm not quite sure where we are... RIVER: Yes. Yes, we've met. (somewhat sadly) Hello, Rory. RORY: What's wrong? RIVER: (laughs nervously) It's my birthday. The Doctor took me ice skating on the River Thames in 1814, the last of the great frost fairs. He got Stevie Wonder to sing for me under London Bridge. RORY: Stevie Wonder sang in 1814? RIVER: Yes, he did. But you must never tell him. RORY: I've come from the Doctor too. RIVER: Yes, but at a different point in time. RORY: Unless there's two of them. RIVER: Now, that's a whole different birthday. (heads for her cell and pulls diary from her muff and reads) RORY: He needs you! RIVER: Demons Run. (closes book) RORY: How...how did you know? RIVER: I'm from his future. I always know. Why on earth are you wearing that? RORY: The Doctor's idea. RIVER: Of course. His rules of engagement. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. RORY: Look ridiculous. RIVER: Have you considered heels? (turns away from RORY) RORY: They've taken Amy. And our baby. RIVER looks sad, almost on the verge of tears. RORY: (walks towards RIVER) The Doctor's getting some people together, we're going after her, but he needs you too. RIVER: I can't. (faces RORY) Not yet, anyway. RORY: I'm sorry? RIVER: This is The Battle of Demons Run. The Doctor's darkest hour. He'll rise higher than ever before and then fall so much further. And...I can't be with him till the very end. RORY: Why not? RIVER: Because this is it. (enters her cell) This is the day he finds out who I am. INT. THE MALDOVARIUM, 5145, NIGHT DORIUM is hurrying with a suitcase. He pauses and looks around. DORIUM: Goodbye. DORIUM then opens his case and rearranges the contents. Figures appear behind him. EYE-PATCH LADY: You appear to be closing down, Dorium. Later they are sitting at a table. EYE-PATCH LADY: What have you heard? DORIUM: That you pricked the side of a mighty beast, Madam Kovarian, and entirely failed to run. (guns are pointed at his head) I admire your courage. I should like to admire it from afar. (pushes the guns away) KOVARIAN: We've been waiting a month. He's done nothing. DORIUM: (counting money) Do you really think so? There are people all over this galaxy that owe that man a debt. By now, a few of them will have found a blue box waiting for them on their doorstep. Poor devils. COLONEL: You think he's raising an army? DORIUM: You think he isn't? If that man is finally collecting on his debts, God help you, and God help his debtors. COLONEL: Why? DORIUM: Colonel Manton, all those stories you've heard about him. They're not stories, they're true. (chuckles) Really you're not telling me you don't know what's coming? MANTON: We're wasting our time here! KOVARIAN: (stands) Agreed. DORIUM: The asteroid, where you've made your base. Do you know why they call it Demons Run? MANTON: How do you know the location of our base? DORIUM: (sighs) You're with the Headless Monks...they're old customers of mine. KOVARIAN: It's just some old saying. DORIUM: A very old saying. The oldest. "Demons run, when a good man goes to war". KOVARIAN and MANTON leave. DORIUM turns in his seat and watches them go. He laughs and walks into a back storage room on his way out. He hears the TARDIS. DORIUM: No. No, no, please! Not me! You don't need me! The TARDIS door opens and light pours out. We see the DOCTOR'S silhouette on the wall behind DORIUM. DORIUM: Why would you need me?! I'm old! I'm fat! I'm blue! You can't need me! INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR MANTON is on a stage, three Headless Monks behind him. The soldiers stand at ease as they listen. KOVARIAN is standing to the side. MANTON: He is not the devil. He is not a god. He is not a goblin, or a phantom or a trickster. The Doctor is a living, breathing man, and as I look around this room I know one thing... We're sure as hell going to fix that. The soldiers cheer. INT. DEMON'S RUN, NURSERY AMY is watching MANTON through the window as LORNA enters. She slowly approaches AMY, holding something in her hand. LORNA: Sorry. I shouldn't be here, I'm meant to be at the thing. I brought you something. Your child's name, in the language of my people. (it is what she was sewing earlier) It's a prayer leaf and we believe, if you keep this with you, your child will always come home to you. AMY: Can I borrow your gun? LORNA: Why? AMY: Cos I've got a feeling you're going to keep talking. (faces window) Talking like he's famous. The Doctor isn't famous... LORNA: He meets a lot of people. Some of them...remember. (smiles) He's sort of like a...I dunno. A dark legend. AMY: Dark?! Have you met him? LORNA: Yeah. AMY turns around. LORNA: But I was just a little girl. AMY: So was I. LORNA: You've been with him a long time then. AMY: No. He came back for me. LORNA: You must be very special. AMY: Hey. You can wait a long time for the Doctor. But he's worth it. OK? (walks to LORNA) The thing is, he's coming. No question about it. Just you make sure you're on the right side when he gets here. Not for my sake...for yours. (holds out her hand and LORNA gives her the prayer leaf) Thank you. AMY holds the prayer leaf between her hands as LORNA leaves. INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR MANTON continues his speech. AMY continues to watch from the window. MANTON: On this day, in this place, the Doctor will fall. The soldiers cheer. MANTON: The man who talks, the man who reasons, the man who lies, will meet the perfect answer. Some of you have wondered why have we have allied ourselves with the Headless Monks. LORNA arrives and takes her position. MANTON: Perhaps you should have wondered why we call them Headless. It's time you knew what these guys have sacrificed for faith. As you all know, it is a Level One Heresy, punishable by death, to lower the hood of a Headless Monk. But by the divine grant of the Papal Mainframe herself, on this one and only occasion, I can show you the truth. Because these guys never can be... (lowers hood of first monk to show a knotted stump where the head and neck should have been) persuaded! They NEVER can be...(lowers hood of second monk) Afraid. (approaches third monk) And they can never, ever be... The monk throws back its own hood to reveal the DOCTOR. DOCTOR: Surprised! The soldiers are stunned and AMY smiles and presses her hands against the window. DOCTOR: Hello everyone! Guess who! (walks to the front of the stage) Please point a gun at me if it helps you relax. All the soldiers-except LORNA-aim their guns at the DOCTOR. The two monks draw energized swords. DOCTOR: You're only human. INT. DEMON'S RUN, COMMUNICATION VASTRA and JENNY enter communication and put swords to the two soldiers' necks. VASTRA: Go on, resist. I'm ever so hungry. JENNY: Now, dear, which button controls the lights? INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR MANTON aims his gun on the DOCTOR. MANTON: Doctor, you will come with me, right now! The DOCTOR turns and smiles at MANTON. DOCTOR: Three minutes, forty seconds. Amelia Pond! Get your coat! The DOCTOR puts his hood back on just as the lights go out. When they come back on, he's gone. DOCTOR: (over speaker) I'm not a phantom. MANTON: Doctor? DOCTOR: (over speaker) I'm not a trickster. MANTON: Doctor? DOCTOR: (over speaker) I'm a monk. MANTON: Doctor, show yourself! SOLDIER: It's him! He's here! (aims gun at the monks) Other soldiers aim their guns at the monks as well. The monks "charge" their swords. SOLDIER: It's him! The SOLDIER shoots one of the monks. There is tension between the two factions. MANTON: Weapons down! Do not fire! One of the monks raises his hand and energy shoots from it, killing a soldier. MANTON: NOOO! The monks and the soldiers start fighting each other. KOVARIAN: (to guards) Follow me. MANTON: Doctor! Doctor! INT. DEMON'S RUN, COMMUNICATION While VASTRA works the controls, JENNY looks at the screen at MANTON JENNY: Clever, isn't he? VASTRA: And rather attractive. Behind them, the two soldiers are tied up on the floor. JENNY: You do realise he's a man, don't you, ma'am? VASTRA: Mammals. They all look alike. JENNY: Oh, thank you! The soldiers work their way to the door lock override on the wall. INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR MANTON aims his gun on the DOCTOR. MANTON: Nobody discharge their weapon in this room. Nobody! LORNA sees a figure in a monk's robe by one of the doors. The DOCTOR uses the sonic MANTON: Do not fire! INT. DEMON'S RUN, COMMUNICATION VASTRA: Was I being insensitive again, dear? I don't know why you put up with me. (turns and uses her long tongue on the soldier) INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR MANTON: Stop, wait! Listen to me! LORNA sees the DOCTOR sneak out the door and follows. MANTON: I'm disarming my weapon pack. (removes pack from gun) Monks, I do this in good faith! I am now unarmed. (places pack on the floor) All of you, discharge your weapon packs. The Doctor is trying to make fools of us... We are soldiers of God, we are not fools! We are not fools! ALL: We are not fools! (soldiers remove packs) MANTON: We are not fools! SOLDIER 2: We are not fools! More soldiers remove packs. MANTON leads the chant and the soldiers continue to follow his head. INT. DEMON'S RUN, COMMUNICATION VASTRA: Colonel Manton is regaining control. JENNY: Where's the Doctor gone? INT. DEMON'S RUN, CORRIDOR LORNA finds the DOCTOR'S discarded disguise and continues to follow. INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR The soldiers continue their chant and soon they are all unarmed and the monks have lowered their swords. A female soldier puts down her weapon and then looks into the face of an armed Silurian. Other Silurians beam in and soon have the soldiers surrounded. Judoon appear as well. STRAX appears on the stage next to MANTON, gun aimed at him. STRAX: This base is now under our command. MANTON: I have a fleet out there! If Demons Run goes down, there's an automatic distress call. DOCTOR: (over speaker) Not if we knock out your communications array. The DOCTOR is on a raised platform overlooking the hangar speaking into a microphone. DOCTOR: And you've got incoming! PILOT: (over speaker) Danny Boy to the Doctor. Danny Boy to the Doctor. DOCTOR: Give 'em hell, Danny Boy! (puts arms out and pretends to be a plane) SPACE The Spitfires from "Victory of the Daleks" fire upon Demon's Run. [SCENE_BREAK] INT. DEMON'S RUN, NURSERY As the asteroid rocks from the hits, AMY smiles. INT. DEMON'S RUN, MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR KOVARIAN and her two soldiers brace themselves. KOVARIAN: I need to get off this station now. Bring me the child! The soldiers turn back. INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR PILOT: Target destroyed. The DOCTOR laughs. INT. DEMON'S RUN, NURSERY AMY laughs. INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR MANTON hangs his head. STRAX: Don't slump, it's bad for your spine! INT. DEMON'S RUN, CORRIDOR The soldiers return carrying the basinet between them. KOVARIAN: Get back in there with the rest of them. Remember, the Doctor must think he's winning, right until the trap closes! I'll take my ship from here. KOVARIAN keys in a code at the door as the two soldiers set down the basinet and leave. LORNA is hiding at a corner. She takes off her pack and leaves quietly. COMPUTER: Airlock engaged. Shuttle ready for boarding. RORY: (holds his sword to KOVARIAN'S neck) No. KOVARIAN: I have a crew of 20. How do you expect to gain control of my ship? RORY scoffs. The airlock doors open and one of her men is pushed out, trussed up. Behind him are AVERY and his son. AVERY aims his pistol at her. AVERY: This ship is ours, m'lady! INT. DEMON'S RUN, COMMUNICATION STRAX is escorting MANTON by gunpoint. STRAX: All airlocks sealed, resistance neutralised! The DOCTOR is sitting at the main control panel. VASTRA, JENNY and DORIUM are also present. DOCTOR: Sorry, Colonel Manton, I lied. Three minutes, 42 seconds. STRAX: Colonel Manton, you will give the order for your men to withdraw. DOCTOR: No. Colonel Manton... I want you to tell your men to run away. MANTON: You what? DOCTOR: Those words. Run away. I want you to be famous for those exact words. I want people to call you Colonel Run-Away. I want children laughing outside your door, cos they've found the house of Colonel Run-Away. (stands and points his finger) And, when people come to you, and ask if trying to get to me through the people I love... is in any way a good idea... I want you to tell them your name. Oh, look! I'm angry. That's new. I'm really not sure what's going to happen now. KOVARIAN arrives escorted by two Silurians. KOVARIAN: The anger of a good man is not a problem. Good men have too many rules. The DOCTOR slowly turns his head to look at her. DOCTOR: Good men don't need rules. (walks over to KOVARIAN) Today is not the day to find out why I have so many. KOVARIAN: Give the order. The DOCTOR pulls back, a little surprised. He smiles crookedly and holds up a finger before walking away. KOVARIAN: Give the order Colonel Run-Away. INT. DEMON'S RUN, NURSERY There is a knocking at the door and AMY runs about, trying to find something to use as a weapon. AMY: Who's that, who's there? (finds something that looks like an industrial thermometer) You watch it, cos I'm armed and really dangerous and...cross! RORY: (through the door) Yeah. Like I don't know that. AMY: Rory? Rory, is that you. RORY: (through the door) Yeah, it's me...(uses the sonic) Hang on a minute. AMY: They took her. Rory, they took our baby away. The doors slide open and RORY is holding MELODY. RORY: Now, Mrs Williams... That is never, ever going to happen. (walks over to AMY) AMY: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. (checks MELODY) Where's she been, what have they done to her... RORY: She's fine. Amy, she's fine, I checked. She's beautiful. (starts crying) Oh, God, I was going to be cool. I wanted to be cool, look at me. AMY: You're OK. Crying Roman with a baby, definitely cool. Come here, you! (kisses him) The DOCTOR stands at the door. DOCTOR: Ugh, kissing and crying, I'll be back in a bit. RORY: Oi! You! Get in here. Now. The DOCTOR hurries over and joins them. He points at MELODY and smiles. RORY: My daughter. What do you think? DOCTOR: Hello. Hello, baby. AMY: Melody. DOCTOR: Melody! Hello, Melody Pond! RORY: Melody Williams. AMY: ..is a geography teacher. Melody Pond is a superhero! The DOCTOR leans over and listens as MELODY gurgles. DOCTOR: (to MELODY) Well, yes, I suppose she does smell nice. Never really sniffed her, maybe I should give it a go. Amelia Pond, c'mere! (hugs her) AMY: Doctor! DOCTOR: I'm sorry we were so long. (sniffs her) AMY: It's OK, I knew you were coming. Both of you. My boys! MELODY squeals. DOCTOR: It's OK, she's still all yours. And really you should call her Mummy, not Big Milk Thing. AMY: OK, what are you doing? DOCTOR: I speak Baby. AMY: No, you don't! DOCTOR: I speak everything...Don't I, Melody Pond? (MELODY gurgles and the DOCTOR straightens his tie) No, it's not...it's cool! VASTRA enters and leans on the rail. VASTRA: Doctor! Take a look. They're leaving. The DOCTOR walks to the window and looks out as the soldiers are marched away. VASTRA: Demons Run is ours without a drop of blood spilled. My friend, you have never risen higher! RORY looks up at VASTRA'S words, remembering what RIVER said. INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR AMY comes out of the TARDIS, comforting MELODY. RORY: Hey what's wrong? AMY: She doesn't like the TARDIS noise. I asked him to turn something off, but it was all "I don't want to punch a hole in the space-time continuum". JENNY and STRAX walk up to them. JENNY: Rory! The Judoon have escorted the Clerics out of the quadrant, Spitfires have returned to their own time, and Captain Avery and his men... Is she all right? AMY: Yes, she's just crying. STRAX: Give her to me, human fool. She needs changing. AMY: I just changed her. I think she might need a feed. STRAX: A feed, of course. I'll take care of everything. (steps forward, hand out) RORY: I really don't think you will, actually. STRAX: I have gene-spliced myself for all nursing duties. I can produce magnificent quantities of lactic fluid. The DOCTOR exits the TARDIS carrying an old fashioned cradle. LORNA: She's not hungry, she's tired. Sorry, Melody, they're just not listening. AMY: What's this?! DOCTOR: Very pretty, according to your daughter. RORY: It's a...it's a cot. DOCTOR: No flies on the Roman. Give her here. Hey! AMY: (hands MELODY to the DOCTOR) There we go. RORY: But where would you get a cot? The DOCTOR puts MELODY in the cot/cradle. AMY: It's old. Really old. Doctor...do you have children? DOCTOR: No. AMY: Have you ever had children? DOCTOR: (to MELODY) No, it's real, it's my hair. AMY: Who slept in here? VASTRA: (over speakers) Doctor! We need you in the main control room. DOCTOR: Be right there! Things to do... I've still got to work out what this base is for. We can't leave till we know. (heads off) AMY: (walks after him) But this is where I was? DOCTOR stops) The whole time I thought I was on the TARDIS, I was really here. DOCTOR: Erm... Centurion, permission to hug? RORY: Be aware, I do have a sword. DOCTOR: At all times. (salutes RORY then hugs AMY) You were on the TARDIS too...your heart, your mind, your soul. But physically, yes, you were still in this place. AMY: And when I saw that face looking through the hatch... that woman looking at me... DOCTOR: Reality bleeding through. They must have taken you quite a while back. Just before America... RORY: That's probably enough hugging now. The DOCTOR and AMY break the hug. RORY: So her flesh avatar was with us all that time. But that means they were projecting a control signal right into the TARDIS. Wherever we were in time and space. DOCTOR: Yeah, they're very clever. AMY: Who are? RORY: Whoever wants our baby. AMY: But why do they want her? DOCTOR: Exactly! RORY: Is there anything you're not telling us? You knew Amy wasn't real, you never said. DOCTOR: Well, I couldn't be sure they weren't listening. AMY: But you always hold out on us. Please, not this time. Doctor, it's our baby. Tell us something. One little thing. DOCTOR: It's mine. RORY: What is? DOCTOR: The cot. It's my cot. I slept in there. RORY looks at the hanging mobile over the cot. AMY: Oh, my God. It's the Doctor's first stars. RORY: She's... AMY reaches into her pocket and pulls out the prayer leaf to wipe around MELODY'S mouth. STRAX: Drop your weapons. State your rank and intent! (he marches LORNA over to them) I found it listening at the door! INT. DEMON'S RUN, COMMUNICATION The DOCTOR enters. DORIUM is sitting at the controls. DOCTOR: You've hacked into their software then? DORIUM: I believe I sold it to them. DOCTOR: So what have we learned? VASTRA: That anger is always the shortest distance to a mistake. DOCTOR: I'm sorry? VASTRA: The words of an old friend who once found me in the London Underground, attempting to avenge my sisters on perfectly innocent tunnel diggers. DOCTOR: Well...You were very cross at the time. VASTRA: As you were today, old friend. Point taken, I hope. The DOCTOR nods in acceptance of her words. VASTRA: Now, I have a question. A simple one. Is Melody human? DOCTOR: Sorry, what? Of course she is! (laughs uncomfortably) Completely human, what are you talking about?! DORIUM: They've been scanning her since she was born and I think they found what they were looking for. (pulls it up on a screen) DOCTOR: (walks over) Human DNA. VASTRA: Look closer. Human plus. Specifically...human plus Time Lord. INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR LORNA: I heard her talking...this is a trap. Why would I lie to you? RORY steps forward. RORY: Well, you might want to take a look at your uniform. LORNA: The only reason I joined the Clerics was to meet the Doctor again. JENNY: You wanted to meet him, so you joined an army to fight him? LORNA: Well, how else do you meet a great warrior? AMY: He's not a warrior. LORNA: Then why's he called the Doctor? The lights go out and AMY and RORY stand by the cot. LORNA: It's starting. Please listen to me. INT. DEMON'S RUN, COMMUNICATION DOCTOR: But she's human. She's Amy and Rory's daughter. VASTRA: You told me about your people. They became what they did through prolonged exposure to the time vortex. The untempered schism... DOCTOR: Over billions of years, it didn't just happen. VASTRA: So how close is she? Could she even regenerate? DOCTOR: No, no! I don't think so. VASTRA: You don't sound so sure. DOCTOR: Because I don't understand how this happened! VASTRA: Which leads me to ask... when did it happen? DOCTOR: When? VASTRA: I am trying to be delicate...I know how you can blush. When did this baby... begin? DOCTOR: Oh, you mean... VASTRA: Quite. DOCTOR: Well, how would I know? That's all human-y, private stuff, it just sort of...goes on. They don't put up a balloon, or anything. (walks down the hall) VASTRA: But could the child have begun on the TARDIS, in flight, in the vortex. DOCTOR: (heads back) No, no, impossible! It's all running about, sexy fish vampires and blowing up stuff. And Rory wasn't even there at the beginning. Then he was dead, then he didn't exist, then he was plastic. Then I had to reboot the whole universe...long story. So technically the first time they were on the TARDIS together, in this version of reality, was on their... VASTRA: On their what? DOCTOR: (gulps) On their wedding night. INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR STRAX: Confirmed. No life forms registering on this base, except us and the Silurians. LORNA: The Headless Monks aren't alive...they don't register as life forms. A monk walks up behind a Silurian. INT. DEMON'S RUN, COMMUNICATION DOCTOR: Doesn't make sense! You can't just cook yourself a Time Lord. VASTRA: Of course not, but you gave them one hell of a start and they've been working very hard ever since. DORIUM: And yet they gave in so easily. Does this not that bother anyone else? DOCTOR: Amy! She worried the baby would have a time head. She said that... VASTRA: Only you would ignore the instincts of a mother! DORIUM: Or the instincts of a coward. This is too easy. There's something wrong. DOCTOR: Why even do it? Even if you could get your hands on a brand new Time Lord, what for? VASTRA: A weapon? DOCTOR: Why would a Time Lord be a weapon? VASTRA: Well...they've seen you. DOCTOR: Me? (sits down, stunned) VASTRA: Mr Maldovar, you're right. This was too easy. We should get back to the others. DOCTOR: (softly) Me? VASTRA and DORIUM leave. The DOCTOR remembers the girl in the spacesuit and what RIVER said while examining the suit. [SCENE_BREAK] FLASHBACK to "Day of the Moon" RIVER: Well, I'd say she's human, going by the life support software. She climbed out of this suit. Like she forced her way out. She must be incredibly strong. [SCENE_BREAK] KOVARIAN appears on the communication screen. KOVARIAN: I see you accessed our files. The DOCTOR stands and faces the screen. KOVARIAN: Do you understand yet? Oh, don't worry, I'm a long way away. But I like to keep tabs on you. The child then... What do you think? DOCTOR: What is she? KOVARIAN: Hope. Hope in this endless, bitter war. DOCTOR: What war? Against who? KOVARIAN: Against you, Doctor. INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR A lift opens and a monk emerges, shooting energy from his hand and killing the Silurian on guard. In the main area, a glowing light appears around the TARDIS. AMY is holding MELODY. AMY: What's that? VASTRA approaches and reaches a hand out to touch it. She pulls it back at the energy she feels. VASTRA: Force field. RORY is on alert. The monks begin chanting as they walk towards them. A loud noise is heard. LORNA: And those are the doors... locking. The monks pass the bodies of Silurians on the ground. The lifts are shut down. VASTRA: Apparently we're not leaving. They hear the chanting. RORY: Is that the Monks? DORIUM: Oh, dear God... that's the attack prayer. RORY: (to AMY) Quick, come with me. (leads her away) VASTRA: Commander Strax! STRAX: I'm trying to seal off this area of the lighting grid. VASTRA: This is where we'll make our stand. Clear lines of sight on all approaches. The monks have their swords out and charged. In another section of the room, RORY helps AMY and MELODY hide behind crates. AMY: Rory, no offence to the others, but you let them all die first, OK? RORY: You're so Scottish. Amy kisses him and RORY kisses MELODY'S head. VASTRA: (calls) Centurion, you're needed! RORY leaves. LORNA is searching through large crates. LORNA: There should be some plasma pistols somewhere. They left everything. STRAX: Then find them, boy! VASTRA: (to JENNY) She's definitely a girl. JENNY: Oh, stop it! DORIUM: (walks towards the monks) We don't have to fight. I'm friends to the Monks, they know me. RORY: Yeah, and they know you just sold them out to the Doctor. DORIUM: Oh, they'll understand. It's only me, only silly old me. (holds his arms out wide) You understand, don't you? VASTRA: Mr Maldovar, get back here! STRAX: Arm yourself, fool! RORY: Dorium! AMY clings to MELODY and hears the sound of a sword and then something hitting the floor. MEDLOY cries. VASTRA: Mr Maldovar? RORY: Dorium? LORNA comes up behind them, passing out guns. They watch as the monks march forward, swords glowing. A headless DORIUM also walks towards them. VASTRA: The child! At all costs, protect the child! RORY draws his sword in one hand and a pistol in the other. The others aim their guns. INT. DEMON'S RUN, COMMUNICATION The DOCTOR slams his hands down in anger as he shouts at KOVARIAN on the screen. DOCTOR: A child is not a weapon! KOVARIAN: Oh, give us time. She can be. She will be. DOCTOR: Except you've already lost her, and I swear I will never let you anywhere near her again. KOVARIAN: Oh, Doctor. Fooling you once was a joy... but fooling you twice, the same way, it's a privilege. DOCTOR: (realizing) Amy... Amy! (runs from the room) INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR AMY tries to console a crying MELODY as the sounds of fighting go on around them. Over AMY'S shoulder where only MELODY can see, a "panel" slides open and KOVARIAN'S face appears. In the main section of the hangar, the fight continues with RORY in the center of it. INT. DEMON'S RUN, CORRIDORS The DOCTOR runs to the others, hoping to get there in time. RIVER: (V.O.) Demons run when a good man goes to war. INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR The fight continues. RIVER: (V.O.) Night will fall and drown the sun when a good man goes to war. AMY consoles MELODY. RIVER: (V.O.) Friendship dies and true love lies. INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR The fight continues. RIVER: (V.O.) Night will fall and the dark will rise when a good man goes to war. INT. DEMON'S RUN, CORRIDORS DOCTOR: Amy! INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR The fight continues. A monk comes up behind STRAX. LORNA is struck by a monk's energy. RIVER: (V.O.) Demons run but count the cost INT. DEMON'S RUN, CORRIDORS RIVER: (V.O.) the battle's won but the child is lost. DOCTOR: Amy! INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR KOVARIAN speaks to MELODY. KOVARIAN: Wakey, wakey! INT. DEMON'S RUN, CORRIDORS The DOCTOR comes to a locked door. DOCTOR: Amy! INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR MELODY bursts. She was Flesh. AMY: (screams) Rory! RORY hears her AMY: Rory! Rory! INT. DEMON'S RUN, CORRIDORS The DOCTOR uses the sonic on the door. DOCTOR: Amy, she's not real! Melody - she's a flesh avatar. (pounds on door) Amy! (door opens) INT. DEMON'S RUN, HANGAR The DOCTOR runs in, the fighting is over. DOCTOR: Amy! (stops at the destruction around him) Amy. RORY: Yeah, we know. RORY walks over to a dying STRAX. STRAX: It's strange. I have often dreamed of dying in combat. I'm not enjoying it as much as I'd hoped. RORY: Come on, Strax, don't give up. STRAX: It's all right, I've had a good life. I'm nearly 12. RORY: Listen to me. You'll be back on your feet in no time. You're a warrior! STRAX: Rory... I'm a nurse. (dies) The DOCTOR sees JENNY with AMY and walks over to them. AMY: So they took her anyway. All this was for nothing. RORY joins them. DOCTOR: I am so... sorry. (goes to hug her bust she backs away) JENNY: Amy... it's not his fault. AMY: (crying) I know, I know. RORY puts his arms around her and comforts her. VASTRA: Doctor, there's someone who wants to speak to you. Her name is Lorna, she came to warn us. The DOCTOR uses the sonic to scan LORNA. He squats down beside her and rubs his face with one hand in frustration. LORNA opens her eyes. DOCTOR: Hey. Hello. LORNA: Doctor! DOCTOR: (smiles) You helped my friends, thank you. LORNA: I met you once. In the Gamma Forests. You don't remember me. DOCTOR: Hey, of course I remember. (holds her face between his hands) I remember everyone. Hey, we ran, you and me! Didn't we run, Lorna? LORNA dies. DOCTOR: (to VASTRA) Who was she? VASTRA: I don't know but she was very brave. DOCTOR: They're always brave. (softer) They're always brave.(stands) VASTRA: So, what now? They'd almost certainly have taken her to Earth, raise her in the correct environment. DOCTOR: Yes, they did. And it's already too late. (walks away) VASTRA: You're giving up? You never do that. DOCTOR: (turns) Don't you sometimes wish I did? There is a bright flash of light and a clap of displaced air. RIVER: Well, then, soldier, how goes the day? The DOCTOR strides over. DOCTOR: Where the hell have you been? Every time you've asked, I have been there. Where the hell were you today? RIVER: I couldn't have prevented this. DOCTOR: You could've tried! RIVER: And so, my love, could you. (looks at AMY and RORY) I know you're not all right. But hold tight, Amy, because you're going to be. DOCTOR: You think I wanted this? (points generally) I didn't do this. This... this wasn't me! RIVER: This was exactly you. All this, all of it. You make them so afraid. When you began, all those years ago, sailing off to see the universe, did you ever think you'd become this? The man who can turn an army around at the mention of his name? Doctor? The word for healer and wise man, throughout the universe. We get that word from you, you know. But if you carry on the way you are, what might that word come to mean? To the people of the Gamma Forests, the word "Doctor" means mighty warrior. How far you've come. And now they've taken a child... the child of your best friends... and they're going to turn her into a weapon, just to bring you down. And all this, my love...in fear of you. DOCTOR: Who are you? RIVER: (lightly) Oh, look, your cot! Haven't seen that in a very long while. (backs up to the cot) DOCTOR: No, no, you tell me. Tell me... who you are. RIVER: (takes his hand) I am telling you. (holds his hand on the cot) Can't you read? The DOCTOR looks at the Gallifreyan writing on the cot and then up at RIVER. He suddenly realizes who she is and smiles. DOCTOR: Hello. RIVER: Hello. DOCTOR: (laughs nervously) But... but that means... RIVER: I'm afraid it does. DOCTOR: (looks at AMY and RORY) Ooh! But you and I, we, we, we, er... (kisses the air) RIVER: Yes. DOCTOR: (looks nervously at AMY and RORY before straightening his tie and jacket) How do I look? RIVER: Amazing. DOCTOR: I'd better be. RIVER: Yes, you'd better be. DOCTOR: (spins) Vastra and Jenny, till the next time. Rory and Amy, I'll find your daughter and on my life, she will be safe. River, get them all home. (heads for the TARDIS) RORY: Doctor? AMY: No! Where are you going? No! The DOCTOR uses the sonic to lift the force field and enters the TARDIS. In the doorway, he laughs and points at RIVER before going inside and closing the door. The TARDIS dematerializes. AMY: (walks towards RIVER) Where's he going? What did you tell him? RIVER: Amy, you have stay calm. AMY: (picks a gun off the floor and aims it at RIVER) Tell me what you told the Doctor. RORY: Amy, no, stop it! RIVER: It's OK, Rory, she's fine, she's good. It's the TARDIS translation matrix, it takes a while to kick in with the written word. You have to concentrate. AMY: (looks at the Gallifreyan on the cot) I still can't read it. RORY takes the gun from AMY. RIVER: It's because it's Gallifreyan and doesn't translate. But this will. (gives AMY the prayer leaf) It's your daughter's name in the language of the forest. AMY: I know my daughter's name. RIVER: Except they don't have a word for "pond" because only water in the forest is the river. The Doctor will find your daughter and he will care for her whatever it takes and I know that. LORNA'S stitching changes in AMY and RORY'S eyes as the translation circuit works. One side becomes "River" and the other "Song". RIVER: It's me. I'm Melody. I'm your daughter.

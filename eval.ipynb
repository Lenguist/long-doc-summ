Maisie asks her father if he liked Miss Overmore \"just the same\" while she was at her mother\\'s . This embarrasses Miss Overmore, even though Beale Farange makes no secret of having been with Miss Overmore the whole time. This is just above Maisie\\'s head. She, too, feels embarrassed and wonders why Miss Overmore has been awkward. She also tries to figure out the nature of her father\\'s relationship to Miss Overmore. Maisie takes to treating her doll, Lisette, the way she herself is treated by her mother and Miss Overmore. She keeps secrets from her doll and even reprimands her for asking indiscreet questions.'"

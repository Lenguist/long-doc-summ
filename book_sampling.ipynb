A man cannot retire\\ninto a desert with his child, and if he did, he could not bring\\nhimself back to childhood, and become the proper friend and\\nplay-fellow of an infant or youth.  And when children are confined\\nto the society of men and women, they very soon acquire that kind\\nof premature manhood which stops the growth of every vigorous power\\nof mind or body.  In order to open their faculties they should be\\nexcited to think for themselves; and this can only be done by\\nmixing a number of children together, and making them jointly\\npursue the same objects.\\n\\nA child very soon contracts a benumbing indolence of mind, which he\\nhas seldom sufficient vigour to shake off, when he only asks a\\nquestion instead of seeking for information, and then relies\\nimplicitly on the answer he receives.  With his equals in age this\\ncould never be the case, and the subjects of inquiry, though they\\nmight be influenced, would not be entirely under the direction of\\nmen, who frequently damp, if not destroy abilities, by bringing\\nthem forward too hastily:  and too hastily they will infallibly be\\nbrought forward, if the child could be confined to the society of a\\nman, however sagacious that man may be.\\n\\nBesides, in youth the seeds of every affection should be sown, and\\nthe respectful regard, which is felt for a parent, is very\\ndifferent from the social affections that are to constitute the\\nhappiness of life as it advances.  Of these, equality is the basis,\\nand an intercourse of sentiments unclogged by that observant\\nseriousness which prevents disputation, though it may not inforce\\nsubmission.  Let a child have ever such an affection for his\\nparent, he will always languish to play and chat with children; and\\nthe very respect he entertains, for filial esteem always has a dash\\nof fear mixed with it, will, if it do not teach him cunning, at\\nleast prevent him from pouring out the little secrets which first\\nopen the heart to friendship and confidence, gradually leading to\\nmore expansive benevolence.  Added to this, he will never acquire\\nthat frank ingenuousness of behaviour, which young people can only\\nattain by being frequently in society, where they dare to speak\\nwhat they think; neither afraid of being reproved for their\\npresumption, nor laughed at for their folly.\\n\\nForcibly impressed by the reflections which the sight of schools,\\nas they are at present conducted, naturally suggested, I have\\nformerly delivered my opinion rather warmly in favour of a private\\neducation; but further experience has led me to view the subject in\\na different light.  I still, however, think schools, as they are\\nnow regulated, the hot-beds of vice and folly, and the knowledge of\\nhuman nature, supposed to be attained there, merely cunning\\nselfishness.\\n\\nAt school, boys become gluttons and slovens, and, instead of\\ncultivating domestic affections, very early rush into the\\nlibertinism which destroys the constitution before it is formed;\\nhardening the heart as it weakens the understanding.\\n\\nI should, in fact, be averse to boarding-schools, if it were for no\\nother reason than the unsettled state of mind which the expectation\\nof the vacations produce.  On these the children\\'s thoughts are\\nfixed with eager anticipating hopes, for, at least, to speak with\\nmoderation, half of the time, and when they arrive they are spent\\nin total dissipation and beastly indulgence.\\n\\nBut, on the contrary, when they are brought up at home, though they\\nmay pursue a plan of study in a more orderly manner than can be\\nadopted, when near a fourth part of the year is actually spent in\\nidleness, and as much more in regret and anticipation; yet they\\nthere acquire too high an opinion of their own importance, from\\nbeing allowed to tyrannize over servants, and from the anxiety\\nexpressed by most mothers, on the score of manners, who, eager to\\nteach the accomplishments of a gentleman, stifle, in their birth,\\nthe virtues of a man.  Thus brought into company when they ought to\\nbe seriously employed, and treated like men when they are still\\nboys, they become vain and effeminate.\\n\\nThe only way to avoid two extremes equally injurious to morality,\\nwould be to contrive some way of combining a public and private\\neducation.  Thus to make men citizens, two natural steps might be\\ntaken, which seem directly to lead to the desired point; for the\\ndomestic affections, that first open the heart to the various\\nmodifications of humanity would be cultivated, whilst the children\\nwere nevertheless allowed to spend great part of their time, on\\nterms of equality, with other children.\\n\\nI still recollect, with pleasure, the country day school; where a\\nboy trudged in the morning, wet or dry, carrying his books, and his\\ndinner, if it were at a considerable distance; a servant did not\\nthen lead master by the hand, for, when he had once put on coat and\\nbreeches, he was allowed to shift for himself, and return alone in\\nthe evening to recount the feats of the day close at the parental\\nknee.  His father\\'s house was his home, and was ever after fondly\\nremembered; nay, I appeal to some superior men who were educated in\\nthis manner, whether the recollection of some shady lane where they\\nconned their lesson; or, of some stile, where they sat making a\\nkite, or mending a bat, has not endeared their country to them?\\n\\nBut, what boy ever recollected with pleasure the years he spent in\\nclose confinement, at an academy near London? unless indeed he\\nshould by chance remember the poor scare-crow of an usher whom he\\ntormented; or, the tartman, from whom he caught a cake, to devour\\nit with the cattish appetite of selfishness.  At boarding schools\\nof every description, the relaxation of the junior boys is\\nmischief; and of the senior, vice.  Besides, in great schools what\\ncan be more prejudicial to the moral character, than the system of\\ntyranny and abject slavery which is established amongst the boys,\\nto say nothing of the slavery to forms, which makes religion worse\\nthan a farce?  For what good can be expected from the youth who\\nreceives the sacrament of the Lord\\'s supper, to avoid forfeiting\\nhalf-a-guinea, which he probably afterwards spends in some sensual\\nmanner?  Half the employment of the youths is to elude the\\nnecessity of attending public worship; and well they may, for such\\na constant repetition of the same thing must be a very irksome\\nrestraint on their natural vivacity.  As these ceremonies have the\\nmost fatal effect on their morals, and as a ritual performed by the\\nlips, when the heart and mind are far away, is not now stored up by\\nour church as a bank to draw on for the fees of the poor souls in\\npurgatory, why should they not be abolished?\\n\\nBut the fear of innovation, in this country, extends to every\\nthing.  This is only a covert fear, the apprehensive timidity of\\nindolent slugs, who guard, by sliming it over, the snug place,\\nwhich they consider in the light of an hereditary estate; and eat,\\ndrink, and enjoy themselves, instead of fulfilling the duties,\\nexcepting a few empty forms, for which it was endowed.  These are\\nthe people who most strenuously insist on the will of the founder\\nbeing observed, crying out against all reformation, as if it were a\\nviolation of justice.  I am now alluding particularly to the\\nrelicks of popery retained in our colleges, where the protestant\\nmembers seem to be such sticklers for the established church; but\\ntheir zeal never makes them lose sight of the spoil of ignorance,\\nwhich rapacious priests of superstitious memory have scraped\\ntogether.  No, wise in their generation, they venerate the\\nprescriptive right of possession, as a strong hold, and still let\\nthe sluggish bell tingle to prayers, as during the days, when the\\nelevation of the host was supposed to atone for the sins of the\\npeople, lest one reformation should lead to another, and the spirit\\nkill the letter.  These Romish customs have the most baneful effect\\non the morals of our clergy; for the idle vermin who two or three\\ntimes a day perform, in the most slovenly manner a service which\\nthey think useless, but call their duty, soon lose a sense of duty.\\nAt college, forced to attend or evade public worship, they acquire\\nan habitual contempt for the very service, the performance of which\\nis to enable them to live in idleness.  It is mumbled over as an\\naffair of business, as a stupid boy repeats his task, and\\nfrequently the college cant escapes from the preacher the moment\\nafter he has left the pulpit, and even whilst he is eating the\\ndinner which he earned in such a dishonest manner.\\n\\nNothing, indeed, can be more irreverent than the cathedral service\\nas it is now performed in this country, neither does it contain a\\nset of weaker men than those who are the slaves of this childish\\nroutine.  A disgusting skeleton of the former state is still\\nexhibited; but all the solemnity, that interested the imagination,\\nif it did not purify the heart, is stripped off.  The performance\\nof high mass on the continent must impress every mind, where a\\nspark of fancy glows, with that awful melancholy, that sublime\\ntenderness, so near a-kin to devotion.  I do not say, that these\\ndevotional feelings are of more use, in a moral sense, than any\\nother emotion of taste; but I contend, that the theatrical pomp\\nwhich gratifies our senses, is to be preferred to the cold parade\\nthat insults the understanding without reaching the heart.\\n\\nAmongst remarks on national education, such observations cannot be\\nmisplaced, especially as the supporters of these establishments,\\ndegenerated into puerilities, affect to be the champions of\\nreligion.  Religion, pure source of comfort in this vale of tears!\\nhow has thy clear stream been muddied by the dabblers, who have\\npresumptuously endeavoured to confine in one narrow channel, the\\nliving waters that ever flow toward God-- the sublime ocean of\\nexistence!  What would life be without that peace which the love of\\nGod, when built on humanity, alone can impart?  Every earthly\\naffection turns back, at intervals, to prey upon the heart that\\nfeeds it; and the purest effusions of benevolence, often rudely\\ndamped by men, must mount as a free-will offering to Him who gave\\nthem birth, whose bright image they faintly reflect.\\n\\nIn public schools, however, religion, confounded with irksome\\nceremonies and unreasonable restraints, assumes the most ungracious\\naspect:  not the sober austere one that commands respect whilst it\\ninspires fear; but a ludicrous cast, that serves to point a pun.\\nFor, in fact, most of the good stories and smart things which\\nenliven the spirits that have been concentrated at whist, are\\nmanufactured out of the incidents to which the very men labour to\\ngive a droll turn who countenance the abuse to live on the spoil.\\n\\nThere is not, perhaps, in the kingdom, a more dogmatical or\\nluxurious set of men, than the pedantic tyrants who reside in\\ncolleges and preside at public schools.  The vacations are equally\\ninjurious to the morals of the masters and pupils, and the\\nintercourse, which the former keep up with the nobility, introduces\\nthe same vanity and extravagance into their families, which banish\\ndomestic duties and comforts from the lordly mansion, whose state\\nis awkwardly aped on a smaller scale.  The boys, who live at a\\ngreat expence with the masters and assistants, are never\\ndomesticated, though placed there for that purpose; for, after a\\nsilent dinner, they swallow a hasty glass of wine, and retire to\\nplan some mischievous trick, or to ridicule the person or manners\\nof the very people they have just been cringing to, and whom they\\nought to consider as the representatives of their parents.\\n\\nCan it then be a matter of surprise, that boys become selfish and\\nvicious who are thus shut out from social converse? or that a mitre\\noften graces the brow of one of these diligent pastors? The desire\\nof living in the same style, as the rank just above them, infects\\neach individual and every class of people, and meanness is the\\nconcomitant of this ignoble ambition; but those professions are\\nmost debasing whose ladder is patronage; yet out of one of these\\nprofessions the tutors of youth are in general chosen.  But, can\\nthey be expected to inspire independent sentiments, whose conduct\\nmust be regulated by the cautious prudence that is ever on the\\nwatch for preferment?\\n\\nSo far, however, from thinking of the morals of boys, I have heard\\nseveral masters of schools argue, that they only undertook to teach\\nLatin and Greek; and that they had fulfilled their duty, by sending\\nsome good scholars to college.\\n\\nA few good scholars, I grant, may have been formed by emulation and\\ndiscipline; but, to bring forward these clever boys, the health and\\nmorals of a number have been sacrificed.\\n\\nThe sons of our gentry and wealthy commoners are mostly educated at\\nthese seminaries, and will any one pretend to assert, that the\\nmajority, making every allowance, come under the description of\\ntolerable scholars?\\n\\nIt is not for the benefit of society that a few brilliant men\\nshould be brought forward at the expence of the multitude.  It is\\ntrue, that great men seem to start up, as great revolutions occur,\\nat proper intervals, to restore order, and to blow aside the clouds\\nthat thicken over the face of truth; but let more reason and virtue\\nprevail in society, and these strong winds would not be necessary.\\nPublic education, of every denomination, should be directed to form\\ncitizens; but if you wish to make good citizens, you must first\\nexercise the affections of a son and a brother.  This is the only\\nway to expand the heart; for public affections, as well as public\\nvirtues, must ever grow out of the private character, or they are\\nmerely meteors that shoot athwart a dark sky, and disappear as they\\nare gazed at and admired.\\n\\nFew, I believe, have had much affection for mankind, who did not\\nfirst love their parents, their brothers, sisters, and even the\\ndomestic brutes, whom they first played with.  The exercise of\\nyouthful sympathies forms the moral temperature; and it is the\\nrecollection of these first affections and pursuits, that gives\\nlife to those that are afterwards more under the direction of\\nreason.  In youth, the fondest friendships are formed, the genial\\njuices mounting at the same time, kindly mix; or, rather the heart,\\ntempered for the reception of friendship, is accustomed to seek for\\npleasure in something more noble than the churlish gratification of\\nappetite.\\n\\nIn order then to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures,\\nchildren ought to be educated at home, for riotous holidays only\\nmake them fond of home for their own sakes.  Yet, the vacations,\\nwhich do not foster domestic affections, continually disturb the\\ncourse of study, and render any plan of improvement abortive which\\nincludes temperance; still, were they abolished, children would be\\nentirely separated from their parents, and I question whether they\\nwould become better citizens by sacrificing the preparatory\\naffections, by destroying the force of relationships that render\\nthe marriage state as necessary as respectable.  But, if a private\\neducation produce self-importance, or insulates a man in his\\nfamily, the evil is only shifted, not remedied.\\n\\nThis train of reasoning brings me back to a subject, on which I\\nmean to dwell, the necessity of establishing proper day-schools.\\n\\nBut these should be national establishments, for whilst\\nschool-masters are dependent on the caprice of parents, little\\nexertion can be expected from them, more than is necessary to\\nplease ignorant people.  Indeed, the necessity of a master\\'s giving\\nthe parents some sample of the boy\\'s abilities, which during the\\nvacation, is shown to every visiter, is productive of more mischief\\nthan would at first be supposed.  For they are seldom done\\nentirely, to speak with moderation, by the child itself; thus the\\nmaster countenances falsehoods, or winds the poor machine up to\\nsome extraordinary exertion, that injures the wheels, and stops the\\nprogress of gradual improvement.  The memory is loaded with\\nunintelligible words, to make a show of, without the\\nunderstanding\\'s acquiring any distinct ideas: but only that\\neducation deserves emphatically to be termed cultivation of mind,\\nwhich teaches young people how to begin to think.  The imagination\\nshould not be allowed to debauch the understanding before it gained\\nstrength, or vanity will become the forerunner of vice:  for every\\nway of exhibiting the acquirements of a child is injurious to its\\nmoral character.\\n\\nHow much time is lost in teaching them to recite what they do not\\nunderstand! whilst, seated on benches, all in their best array, the\\nmammas listen with astonishment to the parrot-like prattle, uttered\\nin solemn cadences, with all the pomp of ignorance and folly.  Such\\nexhibitions only serve to strike the spreading fibres of vanity\\nthrough the whole mind; for they neither teach children to speak\\nfluently, nor behave gracefully.  So far from it, that these\\nfrivolous pursuits might comprehensively be termed the study of\\naffectation: for we now rarely see a simple, bashful boy, though\\nfew people of taste were ever disgusted by that awkward\\nsheepishness so natural to the age, which schools and an early\\nintroduction into society, have changed into impudence and apish\\ngrimace.\\n\\nYet, how can these things be remedied whilst schoolmasters depend\\nentirely on parents for a subsistence; and when so many rival\\nschools hang out their lures to catch the attention of vain fathers\\nand mothers, whose parental affection only leads them to wish, that\\ntheir children should outshine those of their neighbours?\\n\\nWithout great good luck, a sensible, conscientious man, would\\nstarve before he could raise a school, if he disdained to bubble\\nweak parents, by practising the secret tricks of the craft.\\n\\nIn the best regulated schools, however, where swarms are not\\ncrammed together many bad habits must be acquired; but, at common\\nschools, the body, heart, and understanding, are equally stunted,\\nfor parents are often only in quest of the cheapest school, and the\\nmaster could not live, if he did not take a much greater number\\nthan he could manage himself; nor will the scanty pittance, allowed\\nfor each child, permit him to hire ushers sufficient to assist in\\nthe discharge of the mechanical part of the business.  Besides,\\nwhatever appearance the house and garden may make, the children do\\nnot enjoy the comforts of either, for they are continually\\nreminded, by irksome restrictions, that they are not at home, and\\nthe state-rooms, garden, etc. must be kept in order for the\\nrecreation of the parents; who, of a Sunday, visit the school, and\\nare impressed by the very parade that renders the situation of\\ntheir children uncomfortable.\\n\\nWith what disgust have I heard sensible women, for girls are more\\nrestrained and cowed than boys, speak of the wearisome confinement\\nwhich they endured at school.  Not allowed, perhaps, to step out of\\none broad walk in a superb garden, and obliged to pace with steady\\ndeportment stupidly backwards and forwards, holding up their heads,\\nand turning out their toes, with shoulders braced back, instead of\\nbounding, as nature directs to complete her own design, in the\\nvarious attitudes so conducive to health.  The pure animal spirits,\\nwhich make both mind and body shoot out, and unfold the tender\\nblossoms of hope are turned sour, and vented in vain wishes, or\\npert repinings, that contract the faculties and spoil the temper;\\nelse they mount to the brain and sharpening the understanding\\nbefore it gains proportionable strength, produce that pitiful\\ncunning which disgracefully characterizes the female mind--and I\\nfear will ever characterize it whilst women remain the slaves of\\npower!\\n\\nThe little respect which the male world pay to chastity is, I am\\npersuaded, the grand source of many of the physical and moral evils\\nthat torment mankind, as well as of the vices and follies that\\ndegrade and destroy women; yet at school, boys infallibly lose that\\ndecent bashfulness, which might have ripened into modesty at home.\\n\\nI have already animadverted on the bad habits which females acquire\\nwhen they are shut up together; and I think that the observation\\nmay fairly be extended to the other sex, till the natural inference\\nis drawn which I have had in view throughout--that to improve both\\nsexes they ought, not only in private families, but in public\\nschools, to be educated together.  If marriage be the cement of\\nsociety, mankind should all be educated after the same model, or\\nthe intercourse of the sexes will never deserve the name of\\nfellowship, nor will women ever fulfil the peculiar duties of their\\nsex, till they become enlightened citizens, till they become free,\\nby being enabled to earn their own subsistence, independent of men;\\nin the same manner, I mean, to prevent misconstruction, as one man\\nis independent of another.  Nay, marriage will never be held sacred\\ntill women by being brought up with men, are prepared to be their\\ncompanions, rather than their mistresses; for the mean doublings of\\ncunning will ever render them contemptible, whilst oppression\\nrenders them timid.  So convinced am I of this truth, that I will\\nventure to predict, that virtue will never prevail in society till\\nthe virtues of both sexes are founded on reason; and, till the\\naffection common to both are allowed to gain their due strength by\\nthe discharge of mutual duties.\\n\\nWere boys and girls permitted to pursue the same studies together,\\nthose graceful decencies might early be inculcated which produce\\nmodesty, without those sexual distinctions that taint the mind.\\nLessons of politeness, and that formulary of decorum, which treads\\non the heels of falsehood, would be rendered useless by habitual\\npropriety of behaviour.  Not, indeed put on for visiters like the\\ncourtly robe of politeness, but the sober effect of cleanliness of\\nmind.  Would not this simple elegance of sincerity be a chaste\\nhomage paid to domestic affections, far surpassing the meretricious\\ncompliments that shine with false lustre in the heartless\\nintercourse of fashionable life?  But, till more understanding\\npreponderate in society, there will ever be a want of heart and\\ntaste, and the harlot\\'s rouge will supply the place of that\\ncelestial suffusion which only virtuous affections can give to the\\nface.  Gallantry, and what is called love, may subsist without\\nsimplicity of character; but the main pillars of friendship, are\\nrespect and confidence--esteem is never founded on it cannot tell\\nwhat.\\n\\nA taste for the fine arts requires great cultivation; but not more\\nthan a taste for the virtuous affections:  and both suppose that\\nenlargement of mind which opens so many sources of mental pleasure.\\nWhy do people hurry to noisy scenes and crowded circles?  I should\\nanswer, because they want activity of mind, because they have not\\ncherished the virtues of the heart.  They only, therefore, see and\\nfeel in the gross, and continually pine after variety, finding\\nevery thing that is simple, insipid.\\n\\nThis argument may be carried further than philosophers are aware\\nof, for if nature destined woman, in particular, for the discharge\\nof domestic duties, she made her susceptible of the attached\\naffections in a great degree.  Now women are notoriously fond of\\npleasure; and naturally must be so, according to my definition,\\nbecause they cannot enter into the minutiae of domestic taste;\\nlacking judgment the foundation of all taste.  For the\\nunderstanding, in spite of sensual cavillers, reserves to itself\\nthe privilege of conveying pure joy to the heart.\\n\\nWith what a languid yawn have I seen an admirable poem thrown down,\\nthat a man of true taste returns to, again and again with rapture;\\nand, whilst melody has almost suspended respiration, a lady has\\nasked me where I bought my gown.  I have seen also an eye glanced\\ncoldly over a most exquisite picture, rest, sparkling with\\npleasure, on a caricature rudely sketched; and whilst some terrific\\nfeature in nature has spread a sublime stillness through my soul, I\\nhave been desired to observe the pretty tricks of a lap-dog, that\\nmy perverse fate forced me to travel with.  Is it surprising, that\\nsuch a tasteless being should rather caress this dog than her\\nchildren?  Or, that she should prefer the rant of flattery to the\\nsimple accents of sincerity?\\n\\nTo illustrate this remark I must be allowed to observe, that men of\\nthe first genius, and most cultivated minds, have appeared to have\\nthe highest relish for the simple beauties of nature; and they must\\nhave forcibly felt, what they have so well described, the charm,\\nwhich natural affections, and unsophisticated feelings spread round\\nthe human character.  It is this power of looking into the heart,\\nand responsively vibrating with each emotion, that enables the poet\\nto personify each passion, and the painter to sketch with a pencil\\nof fire.\\n\\nTrue taste is ever the work of the understanding employed in\\nobserving natural effects; and till women have more understanding,\\nit is vain to expect them to possess domestic taste.  Their lively\\nsenses will ever be at work to harden their hearts, and the\\nemotions struck out of them will continue to be vivid and\\ntransitory, unless a proper education stores their minds with\\nknowledge.\\n\\nIt is the want of domestic taste, and not the acquirement of\\nknowledge, that takes women out of their families, and tears the\\nsmiling babe from the breast that ought to afford it nourishment.\\nWomen have been allowed to remain in ignorance, and slavish\\ndependence, many, very many years, and still we hear of nothing but\\ntheir fondness of pleasure and sway, their preference of rakes and\\nsoldiers, their childish attachment to toys, and the vanity that\\nmakes them value accomplishments more than virtues.\\n\\nHistory brings forward a fearful catalogue of the crimes which\\ntheir cunning has produced, when the weak slaves have had\\nsufficient address to over-reach their masters.  In France, and in\\nhow many other countries have men been the luxurious despots, and\\nwomen the crafty ministers?  Does this prove that ignorance and\\ndependence domesticate them?  Is not their folly the by-word of the\\nlibertines, who relax in their society; and do not men of sense\\ncontinually lament, that an immoderate fondness for dress and\\ndissipation carries the mother of a family for ever from home?\\nTheir hearts have not been debauched by knowledge, nor their minds\\nled astray by scientific pursuits; yet, they do not fulfil the\\npeculiar duties, which as women they are called upon by nature to\\nfulfil.  On the contrary, the state of warfare which subsists\\nbetween the sexes, makes them employ those wiles, that frustrate\\nthe more open designs of force.\\n\\nWhen, therefore, I call women slaves, I mean in a political and\\ncivil sense; for, indirectly they obtain too much power, and are\\ndebased by their exertions to obtain illicit sway.\\n\\nLet an enlightened nation then try what effect reason would have to\\nbring them back to nature, and their duty; and allowing them to\\nshare the advantages of education and government with man, see\\nwhether they will become better, as they grow wiser and become\\nfree.  They cannot be injured by the experiment; for it is not in\\nthe power of man to render them more insignificant than they are at\\npresent.\\n\\nTo render this practicable, day schools for particular ages should\\nbe established by government, in which boys and girls might be\\neducated together.  The school for the younger children, from five\\nto nine years of age, ought to be absolutely free and open to all\\nclasses.*  A sufficient number of masters should also be chosen by\\na select committee, in each parish, to whom any complaint of\\nnegligence, etc. might be made, if signed by six of the children\\'s\\nparents.\\n\\n(*Footnote.  Treating this part of the subject, I have borrowed\\nsome hints from a very sensible pamphlet written by the late bishop\\nof Autun on public Education.)\\n\\nUshers would then be unnecessary; for, I believe, experience will\\never prove, that this kind of subordinate authority is particularly\\ninjurious to the morals of youth.  What, indeed, can tend to\\ndeprave the character more than outward submission and inward\\ncontempt?  Yet, how can boys be expected to treat an usher with\\nrespect when the master seems to consider him in the light of a\\nservant, and almost to countenance the ridicule which becomes the\\nchief amusement of the boys during the play hours?\\n\\nBut nothing of this kind could occur in an elementary day-school,\\nwhere boys and girls, the rich and poor, should meet together.  And\\nto prevent any of the distinctions of vanity, they should be\\ndressed alike, and all obliged to submit to the same discipline, or\\nleave the school.  The school-room ought to be surrounded by a\\nlarge piece of ground, in which the children might be usefully\\nexercised, for at this age they should not be confined to any\\nsedentary employment for more than an hour at a time.  But these\\nrelaxations might all be rendered a part of elementary education,\\nfor many things improve and amuse the senses, when introduced as a\\nkind of show, to the principles of which dryly laid down, children\\nwould turn a deaf ear.  For instance, botany, mechanics, and\\nastronomy.  Reading, writing, arithmetic, natural history, and some\\nsimple experiments in natural philosophy, might fill up the day;\\nbut these pursuits should never encroach on gymnastic plays in the\\nopen air.  The elements of religion, history, the history of man,\\nand politics, might also be taught by conversations, in the\\nsocratic form.\\n\\nAfter the age of nine, girls and boys, intended for domestic\\nemployments, or mechanical trades, ought to be removed to other\\nschools, and receive instruction, in some measure appropriated to\\nthe destination of each individual, the two sexes being still\\ntogether in the morning; but in the afternoon, the girls should\\nattend a school, where plain work, mantua-making, millinery, etc.\\nwould be their employment.\\n\\nThe young people of superior abilities, or fortune, might now be\\ntaught, in another school, the dead and living languages, the\\nelements of science, and continue the study of history and\\npolitics, on a more extensive scale, which would not exclude polite\\nliterature.  Girls and boys still together? I hear some readers\\nask:  yes.  And I should not fear any other consequence, than that\\nsome early attachment might take place; which, whilst it had the\\nbest effect on the moral character of the young people, might not\\nperfectly agree with the views of the parents, for it will be a\\nlong time, I fear, before the world is so enlightened, that\\nparents, only anxious to render their children virtuous, will let\\nthem choose companions for life themselves.\\n\\nBesides, this would be a sure way to promote early marriages, and\\nfrom early marriages the most salutary physical and moral effects\\nnaturally flow.  What a different character does a married citizen\\nassume from the selfish coxcomb, who lives but for himself, and who\\nis often afraid to marry lest he should not be able to live in a\\ncertain style.  Great emergencies excepted, which would rarely\\noccur in a society of which equality was the basis, a man could\\nonly be prepared to discharge the duties of public life, by the\\nhabitual practice of those inferior ones which form the man.\\n\\nIn this plan of education, the constitution of boys would not be\\nruined by the early debaucheries, which now make men so selfish,\\nnor girls rendered weak and vain, by indolence and frivolous\\npursuits.  But, I presuppose, that such a degree of equality should\\nbe established between the sexes as would shut out gallantry and\\ncoquetry, yet allow friendship and love to temper the heart for the\\ndischarge of higher duties.\\n\\nThese would be schools of morality--and the happiness of man,\\nallowed to flow from the pure springs of duty and affection, what\\nadvances might not the human mind make?  Society can only be happy\\nand free in proportion as it is virtuous; but the present\\ndistinctions, established in society, corrode all private, and\\nblast all public virtue.\\n\\nI have already inveighed against the custom of confining girls to\\ntheir needle, and shutting them out from all political and civil\\nemployments; for by thus narrowing their minds they are rendered\\nunfit to fulfil the peculiar duties which nature has assigned them.\\n\\nOnly employed about the little incidents of the day, they\\nnecessarily grow up cunning.  My very soul has often sickened at\\nobserving the sly tricks practised by women to gain some foolish\\nthing on which their silly hearts were set.  Not allowed to dispose\\nof money, or call any thing their own, they learn to turn the\\nmarket penny; or, should a husband offend, by staying from home, or\\ngive rise to some emotions of jealousy--a new gown, or any pretty\\nbauble, smooths Juno\\'s angry brow.\\n\\nBut these LITTLENESSES would not degrade their character, if women\\nwere led to respect themselves, if political and moral subjects\\nwere opened to them; and I will venture to affirm, that this is the\\nonly way to make them properly attentive to their domestic duties.\\nAn active mind embraces the whole circle of its duties, and finds\\ntime enough for all.  It is not, I assert, a bold attempt to\\nemulate masculine virtues; it is not the enchantment of literary\\npursuits, or the steady investigation of scientific subjects, that\\nlead women astray from duty.  No, it is indolence and vanity --the\\nlove of pleasure and the love of sway, that will reign paramount in\\nan empty mind.  I say empty, emphatically, because the education\\nwhich women now receive scarcely deserves the name.  For the little\\nknowledge they are led to acquire during the important years of\\nyouth, is merely relative to accomplishments; and accomplishments\\nwithout a bottom, for unless the understanding be cultivated,\\nsuperficial and monotonous is every grace.  Like the charms of a\\nmade-up face, they only strike the senses in a crowd; but at home,\\nwanting mind, they want variety.  The consequence is obvious; in\\ngay scenes of dissipation we meet the artificial mind and face, for\\nthose who fly from solitude dread next to solitude, the domestic\\ncircle; not having it in their power to amuse or interest, they\\nfeel their own insignificance, or find nothing to amuse or interest\\nthemselves.\\n\\nBesides, what can be more indelicate than a girl\\'s coming out in\\nthe fashionable world?  Which, in other words, is to bring to\\nmarket a marriageable miss, whose person is taken from one public\\nplace to another, richly caparisoned.  Yet, mixing in the giddy\\ncircle under restraint, these butterflies long to flutter at large,\\nfor the first affection of their souls is their own persons, to\\nwhich their attention has been called with the most sedulous care,\\nwhilst they were preparing for the period that decides their fate\\nfor life.  Instead of pursuing this idle routine, sighing for\\ntasteless show, and heartless state, with what dignity would the\\nyouths of both sexes form attachments in the schools that I have\\ncursorily pointed out; in which, as life advanced, dancing, music,\\nand drawing, might be admitted as relaxations, for at these schools\\nyoung people of fortune ought to remain, more or less, till they\\nwere of age.  Those, who were designed for particular professions,\\nmight attend, three or four mornings in the week, the schools\\nappropriated for their immediate instruction.\\n\\nI only drop these observations at present, as hints; rather, indeed\\nas an outline of the plan I mean, than a digested one; but I must\\nadd, that I highly approve of one regulation mentioned in the\\npamphlet already alluded to (The Bishop of Autun), that of making\\nthe children and youths independent of the masters respecting\\npunishments.  They should be tried by their peers, which would be\\nan admirable method of fixing sound principles of justice in the\\nmind, and might have the happiest effect on the temper, which is\\nvery early soured or irritated by tyranny, till it becomes\\npeevishly cunning, or ferociously overbearing.\\n\\nMy imagination darts forward with benevolent fervour to greet these\\namiable and respectable groups, in spite of the sneering of cold\\nhearts, who are at liberty to utter, with frigid self-importance,\\nthe damning epithet-- romantic; the force of which I shall\\nendeavour to blunt by repeating the words of an eloquent moralist.\\n\"I know not whether the allusions of a truly humane heart, whose\\nzeal renders every thing easy, is not preferable to that rough and\\nrepulsing reason, which always finds in indifference for the public\\ngood, the first obstacle to whatever would promote it.\"\\n\\nI know that libertines will also exclaim, that woman would be\\nunsexed by acquiring strength of body and mind, and that beauty,\\nsoft bewitching beauty! would no longer adorn the daughters of men.\\nI am of a very different opinion, for I think, that, on the\\ncontrary, we should then see dignified beauty, and true grace; to\\nproduce which, many powerful physical and moral causes would\\nconcur.  Not relaxed beauty, it is true, nor the graces of\\nhelplessness; but such as appears to make us respect the human body\\nas a majestic pile, fit to receive a noble inhabitant, in the\\nrelics of antiquity.\\n\\nI do not forget the popular opinion, that the Grecian statues were\\nnot modelled after nature.  I mean, not according to the\\nproportions of a particular man; but that beautiful limbs and\\nfeatures were selected from various bodies to form an harmonious\\nwhole.  This might, in some degree, be true.  The fine ideal\\npicture of an exalted imagination might be superior to the\\nmaterials which the painter found in nature, and thus it might with\\npropriety be termed rather the model of mankind than of a man.  It\\nwas not, however, the mechanical selection of limbs and features,\\nbut the ebullition of an heated fancy that burst forth; and the\\nfine senses and enlarged understanding of the artist selected the\\nsolid matter, which he drew into this glowing focus.\\n\\nI observed that it was not mechanical, because a whole was\\nproduced--a model of that grand simplicity, of those concurring\\nenergies, which arrest our attention and command our reverence.\\nFor only insipid lifeless beauty is produced by a servile copy of\\neven beautiful nature.  Yet, independent of these observations, I\\nbelieve, that the human form must have been far more beautiful than\\nit is at present, because extreme indolence, barbarous ligatures,\\nand many causes, which forcibly act on it, in our luxurious state\\nof society, did not retard its expansion, or render it deformed.\\nExercise and cleanliness appear to be not only the surest means of\\npreserving health, but of promoting beauty, the physical causes\\nonly considered; yet, this is not sufficient, moral ones must\\nconcur, or beauty will be merely of that rustic kind which blooms\\non the innocent, wholesome countenances of some country people,\\nwhose minds have not been exercised.  To render the person perfect,\\nphysical and moral beauty ought to be attained at the same time;\\neach lending and receiving force by the combination.  Judgment must\\nreside on the brow, affection and fancy beam in the eye, and\\nhumanity curve the cheek, or vain is the sparkling of the finest\\neye or the elegantly turned finish of the fairest features;  whilst\\nin every motion that displays the active limbs and well-knit\\njoints, grace and modesty should appear.  But this fair assemblage\\nis not to be brought together by chance; it is the reward of\\nexertions met to support each other; for judgment can only be\\nacquired by reflection, affection, by the discharge of duties, and\\nhumanity by the exercise of compassion to every living creature.\\n\\nHumanity to animals should be particularly inculcated as a part of\\nnational education, for it is not at present one of our national\\nvirtues.  Tenderness for their humble dumb domestics, amongst the\\nlower class, is oftener to be found in a savage than a civilized\\nstate.  For civilization prevents that intercourse which creates\\naffection in the rude hut, or mud cabin, and leads uncultivated\\nminds who are only depraved by the refinements which prevail in the\\nsociety, where they are trodden under foot by the rich, to domineer\\nover them to revenge the insults that they are obliged to bear from\\ntheir superiours.\\n\\nThis habitual cruelty is first caught at school, where it is one of\\nthe rare sports of the boys to torment the miserable brutes that\\nfall in their way.  The transition, as they grow up, from barbarity\\nto brutes to domestic tyranny over wives, children, and servants,\\nis very easy.  Justice, or even benevolence, will not be a powerful\\nspring of action, unless it extend to the whole creation; nay, I\\nbelieve that it may be delivered as an axiom, that those who can\\nsee pain, unmoved, will soon learn to inflict it.\\n\\nThe vulgar are swayed by present feelings, and the habits which\\nthey have accidentally acquired; but on partial feelings much\\ndependence cannot be placed, though they be just; for, when they\\nare not invigorated by reflection, custom weakens them, till they\\nare scarcely felt.  The sympathies of our nature are strengthened\\nby pondering cogitations, and deadened by thoughtless use.\\nMacbeth\\'s heart smote him more for one murder, the first, than for\\na hundred subsequent ones, which were necessary to back it.  But,\\nwhen I used the epithet vulgar, I did not mean to confine my remark\\nto the poor, for partial humanity, founded on present sensations or\\nwhim, is quite as conspicuous, if not more so, amongst the rich.\\n\\nThe lady who sheds tears for the bird starved in a snare, and\\nexecrates the devils in the shape of men, who goad to madness the\\npoor ox, or whip the patient ass, tottering under a burden above\\nits strength, will, nevertheless, keep her coachman and horses\\nwhole hours waiting for her, when the sharp frost bites, or the\\nrain beats against the well-closed windows which do not admit a\\nbreath of air to tell her how roughly the wind blows without.  And\\nshe who takes her dogs to bed, and nurses them with a parade of\\nsensibility, when sick, will suffer her babes to grow up crooked in\\na nursery.  This illustration of my argument is drawn from a matter\\nof fact.  The woman whom I allude to was handsome, reckoned very\\nhandsome, by those who do not miss the mind when the face is plump\\nand fair; but her understanding had not been led from female duties\\nby literature, nor her innocence debauched by knowledge.  No, she\\nwas quite feminine, according to the masculine acceptation of the\\nword; and, so far from loving these spoiled brutes that filled the\\nplace which her children ought to have occupied, she only lisped\\nout a pretty mixture of French and English nonsense, to please the\\nmen who flocked round her.  The wife, mother, and human creature,\\nwere all swallowed up by the factitious character, which an\\nimproper education, and the selfish vanity of beauty, had produced.\\n\\nI do not like to make a distinction without a difference, and I own\\nthat I have been as much disgusted by the fine lady who took her\\nlap-dog to her bosom, instead of her child; as by the ferocity of a\\nman, who, beating his horse, declared, that he knew as well when he\\ndid wrong as a Christian.\\n\\nThis brood of folly shows how mistaken they are who, if they allow\\nwomen to leave their harams, do not cultivate their understanding,\\nin order to plant virtues in their hearts.  For had they sense,\\nthey might acquire that domestic taste which would lead them to\\nlove with reasonable subordination their whole family, from the\\nhusband to the house-dog; nor would they ever insult humanity in\\nthe person of the most menial servant, by paying more attention to\\nthe comfort of a brute, than to that of a fellow-creature.\\n\\nMy observations on national education are obviously hints; but I\\nprincipally wish to enforce the necessity of educating the sexes\\ntogether to perfect both, and of making children sleep at home,\\nthat they may learn to love home; yet to make private support\\ninstead of smothering public affections, they should be sent to\\nschool to mix with a number of equals, for only by the jostlings of\\nequality can we form a just opinion of ourselves.\\n\\nTo render mankind more virtuous, and happier of course, both sexes\\nmust act from the same principle; but how can that be expected when\\nonly one is allowed to see the reasonableness of it?  To render\\nalso the social compact truly equitable, and in order to spread\\nthose enlightening principles, which alone can meliorate the fate\\nof man, women must be allowed to found their virtue on knowledge,\\nwhich is scarcely possible unless they be educated by the same\\npursuits as men.  For they are now made so inferiour by ignorance\\nand low desires, as not to deserve to be ranked with them; or, by\\nthe serpentine wrigglings of cunning they mount the tree of\\nknowledge and only acquire sufficient to lead men astray.\\n\\nIt is plain from the history of all nations, that women cannot be\\nconfined to merely domestic pursuits, for they will not fulfil\\nfamily duties, unless their minds take a wider range, and whilst\\nthey are kept in ignorance, they become in the same proportion, the\\nslaves of pleasure as they are the slaves of man.  Nor can they be\\nshut out of great enterprises, though the narrowness of their minds\\noften make them mar what they are unable to comprehend.\\n\\nThe libertinism, and even the virtues of superior men, will always\\ngive women, of some description, great power over them; and these\\nweak women, under the influence of childish passions and selfish\\nvanity, will throw a false light over the objects which the very\\nmen view with their eyes, who ought to enlighten their judgment.\\nMen of fancy, and those sanguine characters who mostly hold the\\nhelm of human affairs, in general, relax in the society of women;\\nand surely I need not cite to the most superficial reader of\\nhistory, the numerous examples of vice and oppression which the\\nprivate intrigues of female favourites have produced; not to dwell\\non the mischief that naturally arises from the blundering\\ninterposition of well-meaning folly.  For in the transactions of\\nbusiness it is much better to have to deal with a knave than a\\nfool, because a knave adheres to some plan; and any plan of reason\\nmay be seen through much sooner than a sudden flight of folly.  The\\npower which vile and foolish women have had over wise men, who\\npossessed sensibility, is notorious; I shall only mention one\\ninstance.\\n\\nWhoever drew a more exalted female character than Rousseau?  though\\nin the lump he constantly endeavoured to degrade the sex.  And why\\nwas he thus anxious?  Truly to justify to himself the affection\\nwhich weakness and virtue had made him cherish for that fool\\nTheresa.  He could not raise her to the common level of her sex;\\nand therefore he laboured to bring woman down to her\\'s.  He found\\nher a convenient humble companion, and pride made him determine to\\nfind some superior virtues in the being whom he chose to live with;\\nbut did not her conduct during his life, and after his death,\\nclearly show how grossly he was mistaken who called her a celestial\\ninnocent.  Nay, in the bitterness of his heart, he himself laments,\\nthat when his bodily infirmities made him no longer treat her like\\na woman, she ceased to have an affection for him.  And it was very\\nnatural that she should, for having so few sentiments in common,\\nwhen the sexual tie was broken, what was to hold her?  To hold her\\naffection whose sensibility was confined to one sex, nay, to one\\nman, it requires sense to turn sensibility into the broad channel\\nof humanity: many women have not mind enough to have an affection\\nfor a woman, or a friendship for a man.  But the sexual weakness\\nthat makes woman depend on man for a subsistence, produces a kind\\nof cattish affection, which leads a wife to purr about her husband,\\nas she would about any man who fed and caressed her.\\n\\nMen, are however, often gratified by this kind of fondness which is\\nconfined in a beastly manner to themselves, but should they ever\\nbecome more virtuous, they will wish to converse at their fire-side\\nwith a friend, after they cease to play with a mistress.  Besides,\\nunderstanding is necessary to give variety and interest to sensual\\nenjoyments, for low, indeed, in the intellectual scale, is the mind\\nthat can continue to love when neither virtue nor sense give a\\nhuman appearance to an animal appetite.  But sense will always\\npreponderate; and if women are not, in general, brought more on a\\nlevel with men, some superior women, like the Greek courtezans will\\nassemble the men of abilities around them, and draw from their\\nfamilies many citizens, who would have stayed at home, had their\\nwives had more sense, or the graces which result from the exercise\\nof the understanding and fancy, the legitimate parents of taste.  A\\nwoman of talents, if she be not absolutely ugly, will always obtain\\ngreat power, raised by the weakness of her sex; and in proportion\\nas men acquire virtue and delicacy: by the exertion of reason, they\\nwill look for both in women, but they can only acquire them in the\\nsame way that men do.\\n\\nIn France or Italy have the women confined themselves to domestic\\nlife? though they have not hitherto had a political existence, yet,\\nhave they not illicitly had great sway? corrupting themselves and\\nthe men with whose passions they played?  In short, in whatever\\nlight I view the subject, reason and experience convince me, that\\nthe only method of leading women to fulfil their peculiar duties,\\nis to free them from all restraint by allowing them to participate\\nthe inherent rights of mankind.\\n\\nMake them free, and they will quickly become wise and virtuous, as\\nmen become more so; for the improvement must be mutual, or the\\njustice which one half of the human race are obliged to submit to,\\nretorting on their oppressors, the virtue of man will be worm-eaten\\nby the insect whom he keeps under his feet.\\n\\nLet men take their choice, man and woman were made for each other,\\nthough not to become one being; and if they will not improve women,\\nthey will deprave them!\\n\\nI speak of the improvement and emancipation of the whole sex, for I\\nknow that the behaviour of a few women, who by accident, or\\nfollowing a strong bent of nature, have acquired a portion of\\nknowledge superior to that of the rest of their sex, has often been\\nover-bearing; but there have been instances of women who, attaining\\nknowledge, have not discarded modesty, nor have they always\\npedantically appeared to despise the ignorance which they laboured\\nto disperse in their own minds.  The exclamations then which any\\nadvice respecting female learning, commonly produces, especially\\nfrom pretty women, often arise from envy.  When they chance to see\\nthat even the lustre of their eyes, and the flippant sportiveness\\nof refined coquetry will not always secure them attention, during a\\nwhole evening, should a woman of a more cultivated understanding\\nendeavour to give a rational turn to the conversation, the common\\nsource of consolation is, that such women seldom get husbands.\\nWhat arts have I not seen silly women use to interrupt by\\nFLIRTATION, (a very significant word to describe such a manoeuvre)\\na rational conversation, which made the men forget that they were\\npretty women.\\n\\nBut, allowing what is very natural to man--that the possession of\\nrare abilities is really calculated to excite over-weening pride,\\ndisgusting in both men and women--in what a state of inferiority\\nmust the female faculties have rusted when such a small portion of\\nknowledge as those women attained, who have sneeringly been termed\\nlearned women, could be singular? Sufficiently so to puff up the\\npossessor, and excite envy in her contemporaries, and some of the\\nother sex.  Nay, has not a little rationality exposed many women to\\nthe severest censure?  I advert to well known-facts, for I have\\nfrequently heard women ridiculed, and every little weakness\\nexposed, only because they adopted the advice of some medical men,\\nand deviated from the beaten track in their mode of treating their\\ninfants.  I have actually heard this barbarous aversion to\\ninnovation carried still further, and a sensible woman stigmatized\\nas an unnatural mother, who has thus been wisely solicitous to\\npreserve the health of her children, when in the midst of her care\\nshe has lost one by some of the casualties of infancy which no\\nprudence can ward off.  Her acquaintance have observed, that this\\nwas the consequence of new-fangled notions--the new-fangled notions\\nof ease and cleanliness.  And those who, pretending to experience,\\nthough they have long adhered to prejudices that have, according to\\nthe opinion of the most sagacious physicians, thinned the human\\nrace, almost rejoiced at the disaster that gave a kind of sanction\\nto prescription.\\n\\nIndeed, if it were only on this account, the national education of\\nwomen is of the utmost consequence; for what a number of human\\nsacrifices are made to that moloch, prejudice!  And in how many\\nways are children destroyed by the lasciviousness of man?  The want\\nof natural affection in many women, who are drawn from their duty\\nby the admiration of men, and the ignorance of others, render the\\ninfancy of man a much more perilous state than that of brutes; yet\\nmen are unwilling to place women in situations proper to enable\\nthem to acquire sufficient understanding to know how even to nurse\\ntheir babes.\\n\\nSo forcibly does this truth strike me, that I would rest the whole\\ntendency of my reasoning upon it; for whatever tends to\\nincapacitate the maternal character, takes woman out of her sphere.\\n\\nBut it is vain to expect the present race of weak mothers either to\\ntake that reasonable care of a child\\'s body, which is necessary to\\nlay the foundation of a good constitution, supposing that it do not\\nsuffer for the sins of its fathers; or to manage its temper so\\njudiciously that the child will not have, as it grows up, to throw\\noff all that its mother, its first instructor, directly or\\nindirectly taught, and unless the mind have uncommon vigour,\\nwomanish follies will stick to the character throughout life.  The\\nweakness of the mother will be visited on the children!  And whilst\\nwomen are educated to rely on their husbands for judgment, this\\nmust ever be the consequence, for there is no improving an\\nunderstanding by halves, nor can any being act wisely from\\nimitation, because in every circumstance of life there is a kind of\\nindividuality, which requires an exertion of judgment to modify\\ngeneral rules.  The being who can think justly in one track, will\\nsoon extend its intellectual empire; and she who has sufficient\\njudgment to manage her children, will not submit right or wrong, to\\nher husband, or patiently to the social laws which makes a\\nnonentity of a wife.\\n\\nIn public schools women, to guard against the errors of ignorance,\\nshould be taught the elements of anatomy and medicine, not only to\\nenable them to take proper care of their own health, but to make\\nthem rational nurses of their infants, parents, and husbands; for\\nthe bills of mortality are swelled by the blunders of self-willed\\nold women, who give nostrums of their own, without knowing any\\nthing of the human frame.  It is likewise proper, only in a\\ndomestic view, to make women, acquainted with the anatomy of the\\nmind, by allowing the sexes to associate together in every pursuit;\\nand by leading them to observe the progress of the human\\nunderstanding in the improvement of the sciences and arts; never\\nforgetting the science of morality, nor the study of the political\\nhistory of mankind.\\n\\nA man has been termed a microcosm; and every family might also be\\ncalled a state.  States, it is true, have mostly been governed by\\narts that disgrace the character of man; and the want of a just\\nconstitution, and equal laws, have so perplexed the notions of the\\nworldly wise, that they more than question the reasonableness of\\ncontending for the rights of humanity.  Thus morality, polluted in\\nthe national reservoir, sends off streams of vice to corrupt the\\nconstituent parts of the body politic; but should more noble, or\\nrather more just principles regulate the laws, which ought to be\\nthe government of society, and not those who execute them, duty\\nmight become the rule of private conduct.\\n\\nBesides, by the exercise of their bodies and minds, women would\\nacquire that mental activity so necessary in the maternal\\ncharacter, united with the fortitude that distinguishes steadiness\\nof conduct from the obstinate perverseness of weakness.  For it is\\ndangerous to advise the indolent to be steady, because they\\ninstantly become rigorous, and to save themselves trouble, punish\\nwith severity faults that the patient fortitude of reason might\\nhave prevented.\\n\\nBut fortitude presupposes strength of mind, and is strength of mind\\nto be acquired by indolent acquiescence?  By asking advice instead\\nof exerting the judgment?  By obeying through fear, instead of\\npractising the forbearance, which we all stand in need of\\nourselves?  The conclusion which I wish to draw is obvious; make\\nwomen rational creatures and free citizens, and they will quickly\\nbecome good wives, and mothers; that is--if men do not neglect the\\nduties of husbands and fathers.\\n\\nDiscussing the advantages which a public and private education\\ncombined, as I have sketched, might rationally be expected to\\nproduce, I have dwelt most on such as are particularly relative to\\nthe female world, because I think the female world oppressed; yet\\nthe gangrene which the vices, engendered by oppression have\\nproduced, is not confined to the morbid part, but pervades society\\nat large;  so that when I wish to see my sex become more like moral\\nagents, my heart bounds with the anticipation of the general\\ndiffusion of that sublime contentment which only morality can\\ndiffuse.\\n\\n',\n",

              " [{'chapter-content': '\\nIn the present state of society, it appears necessary to go back to\\nfirst principles in search of the most simple truths, and to\\ndispute with some prevailing prejudice every inch of ground.  To\\nclear my way, I must be allowed to ask some plain questions, and\\nthe answers will probably appear as unequivocal as the axioms on\\nwhich reasoning is built; though, when entangled with various\\nmotives of action, they are formally contradicted, either by the\\nwords or conduct of men.\\n\\nIn what does man\\'s pre-eminence over the brute creation consist?\\nThe answer is as clear as that a half is less than the whole; in\\nReason.\\n\\nWhat acquirement exalts one being above another?  Virtue; we\\nspontaneously reply.\\n\\nFor what purpose were the passions implanted?  That man by\\nstruggling with them might attain a degree of knowledge denied to\\nthe brutes:  whispers Experience.\\n\\nConsequently the perfection of our nature and capability of\\nhappiness, must be estimated by the degree of reason, virtue, and\\nknowledge, that distinguish the individual, and direct the laws\\nwhich bind society:  and that from the exercise of reason,\\nknowledge and virtue naturally flow, is equally undeniable, if\\nmankind be viewed collectively.\\n\\nThe rights and duties of man thus simplified, it seems almost\\nimpertinent to attempt to illustrate truths that appear so\\nincontrovertible:  yet such deeply rooted prejudices have clouded\\nreason, and such spurious qualities have assumed the name of\\nvirtues, that it is necessary to pursue the course of reason as it\\nhas been perplexed and involved in error, by various adventitious\\ncircumstances, comparing the simple axiom with casual deviations.\\n\\nMen, in general, seem to employ their reason to justify prejudices,\\nwhich they have imbibed, they cannot trace how, rather than to root\\nthem out.  The mind must be strong that resolutely forms its own\\nprinciples; for a kind of intellectual cowardice prevails which\\nmakes many men shrink from the task, or only do it by halves.  Yet\\nthe imperfect conclusions thus drawn, are frequently very\\nplausible, because they are built on partial experience, on just,\\nthough narrow, views.\\n\\nGoing back to first principles, vice skulks, with all its native\\ndeformity, from close investigation; but a set of shallow reasoners\\nare always exclaiming that these arguments prove too much, and that\\na measure rotten at the core may be expedient.  Thus expediency is\\ncontinually contrasted with simple principles, till truth is lost\\nin a mist of words, virtue in forms, and knowledge rendered a\\nsounding nothing, by the specious prejudices that assume its name.\\n\\nThat the society is formed in the wisest manner, whose constitution\\nis founded on the nature of man, strikes, in the abstract, every\\nthinking being so forcibly, that it looks like presumption to\\nendeavour to bring forward proofs; though proof must be brought, or\\nthe strong hold of prescription will never be forced by reason; yet\\nto urge prescription as an argument to justify the depriving men\\n(or women) of their natural rights, is one of the absurd sophisms\\nwhich daily insult common sense.\\n\\nThe civilization of the bulk of the people of Europe, is very\\npartial; nay, it may be made a question, whether they have acquired\\nany virtues in exchange for innocence, equivalent to the misery\\nproduced by the vices that have been plastered over unsightly\\nignorance, and the freedom which has been bartered for splendid\\nslavery.  The desire of dazzling by riches, the most certain\\npre-eminence that man can obtain, the pleasure of commanding\\nflattering sycophants, and many other complicated low calculations\\nof doting self-love, have all contributed to overwhelm the mass of\\nmankind, and make liberty a convenient handle for mock patriotism.\\nFor whilst rank and titles are held of the utmost importance,\\nbefore which Genius \"must hide its diminished head,\" it is, with a\\nfew exceptions, very unfortunate for a nation when a man of\\nabilities, without rank or property, pushes himself forward to\\nnotice.  Alas! what unheard of misery have thousands suffered to\\npurchase a cardinal\\'s hat for an intriguing obscure adventurer, who\\nlonged to be ranked with princes, or lord it over them by seizing\\nthe triple crown!\\n\\nSuch, indeed, has been the wretchedness that has flowed from\\nhereditary honours, riches, and monarchy, that men of lively\\nsensibility have almost uttered blasphemy in order to justify the\\ndispensations of providence.  Man has been held out as independent\\nof his power who made him, or as a lawless planet darting from its\\norbit to steal the celestial fire of reason; and the vengeance of\\nheaven, lurking in the subtile flame, sufficiently punished his\\ntemerity, by introducing evil into the world.\\n\\nImpressed by this view of the misery and disorder which pervaded\\nsociety, and fatigued with jostling against artificial fools,\\nRousseau became enamoured of solitude, and, being at the same time\\nan optimist, he labours with uncommon eloquence to prove that man\\nwas naturally a solitary animal.  Misled by his respect for the\\ngoodness of God, who certainly for what man of sense and feeling\\ncan doubt it! gave life only to communicate happiness, he considers\\nevil as positive, and the work of man; not aware that he was\\nexalting one attribute at the expense of another, equally necessary\\nto divine perfection.\\n\\nReared on a false hypothesis, his arguments in favour of a state of\\nnature are plausible, but unsound.  I say unsound; for to assert\\nthat a state of nature is preferable to civilization in all its\\npossible perfection, is, in other words, to arraign supreme wisdom;\\nand the paradoxical exclamation, that God has made all things\\nright, and that evil has been introduced by the creature whom he\\nformed, knowing what he formed, is as unphilosophical as impious.\\n\\nWhen that wise Being, who created us and placed us here, saw the\\nfair idea, he willed, by allowing it to be so, that the passions\\nshould unfold our reason, because he could see that present evil\\nwould produce future good.  Could the helpless creature whom he\\ncalled from nothing, break loose from his providence, and boldly\\nlearn to know good by practising evil without his permission?  No.\\nHow could that energetic advocate for immortality argue so\\ninconsistently?  Had mankind remained for ever in the brutal state\\nof nature, which even his magic pen cannot paint as a state in\\nwhich a single virtue took root, it would have been clear, though\\nnot to the sensitive unreflecting wanderer, that man was born to\\nrun the circle of life and death, and adorn God\\'s garden for some\\npurpose which could not easily be reconciled with his attributes.\\n\\nBut if, to crown the whole, there were to be rational creatures\\nproduced, allowed to rise in excellency by the exercise of powers\\nimplanted for that purpose; if benignity itself thought fit to call\\ninto existence a creature above the brutes, who could think and\\nimprove himself, why should that inestimable gift, for a gift it\\nwas, if a man was so created as to have a capacity to rise above\\nthe state in which sensation produced brutal ease, be called, in\\ndirect terms, a curse?  A curse it might be reckoned, if all our\\nexistence was bounded by our continuance in this world; for why\\nshould the gracious fountain of life give us passions, and the\\npower of reflecting, only to embitter our days, and inspire us with\\nmistaken notions of dignity?  Why should he lead us from love of\\nourselves to the sublime emotions which the discovery of his wisdom\\nand goodness excites, if these feelings were not set in motion to\\nimprove our nature, of which they make a part, and render us\\ncapable of enjoying a more godlike portion of happiness?  Firmly\\npersuaded that no evil exists in the world that God did not design\\nto take place, I build my belief on the perfection of God.\\n\\nRousseau exerts himself to prove, that all WAS right originally:  a\\ncrowd of authors that all IS now right:  and I, that all WILL BE\\nright.\\n\\nBut, true to his first position, next to a state of nature,\\nRousseau celebrates barbarism, and, apostrophizing the shade of\\nFabricius, he forgets that, in conquering the world, the Romans\\nnever dreamed of establishing their own liberty on a firm basis, or\\nof extending the reign of virtue.  Eager to support his system, he\\nstigmatizes, as vicious, every effort of genius; and uttering the\\napotheosis of savage virtues, he exalts those to demigods, who were\\nscarcely human--the brutal Spartans, who in defiance of justice and\\ngratitude, sacrificed, in cold blood, the slaves that had shown\\nthemselves men to rescue their oppressors.\\n\\nDisgusted with artificial manners and virtues, the citizen of\\nGeneva, instead of properly sifting the subject, threw away the\\nwheat with the chaff, without waiting to inquire whether the evils,\\nwhich his ardent soul turned from indignantly, were the consequence\\nof civilization, or the vestiges of barbarism.  He saw vice\\ntrampling on virtue, and the semblance of goodness taking place of\\nthe reality; he saw talents bent by power to sinister purposes, and\\nnever thought of tracing the gigantic mischief up to arbitrary\\npower, up to the hereditary distinctions that clash with the mental\\nsuperiority that naturally raises a man above his fellows.  He did\\nnot perceive, that the regal power, in a few generations,\\nintroduces idiotism into the noble stem, and holds out baits to\\nrender thousands idle and vicious.\\n\\nNothing can set the regal character in a more contemptible point of\\nview, than the various crimes that have elevated men to the supreme\\ndignity.  Vile intrigues, unnatural crimes, and every vice that\\ndegrades our nature, have been the steps to this distinguished\\neminence; yet millions of men have supinely allowed the nerveless\\nlimbs of the posterity of such rapacious prowlers, to rest quietly\\non their ensanguined thrones.\\n\\nWhat but a pestilential vapour can hover over society, when its\\nchief director is only instructed in the invention of crimes, or\\nthe stupid routine of childish ceremonies?  Will men never be wise?\\nwill they never cease to expect corn from tares, and figs from\\nthistles?\\n\\nIt is impossible for any man, when the most favourable\\ncircumstances concur, to acquire sufficient knowledge and strength\\nof mind to discharge the duties of a king, entrusted with\\nuncontrolled power; how then must they be violated when his very\\nelevation is an insuperable bar to the attainment of either wisdom\\nor virtue; when all the feelings of a man are stifled by flattery,\\nand reflection shut out by pleasure!  Surely it is madness to make\\nthe fate of thousands depend on the caprice of a weak fellow\\ncreature, whose very station sinks him NECESSARILY below the\\nmeanest of his subjects!  But one power should not be thrown down\\nto exalt another--for all power intoxicates weak man; and its abuse\\nproves, that the more equality there is established among men, the\\nmore virtue and happiness will reign in society.  But this, and any\\nsimilar maxim deduced from simple reason, raises an outcry--the\\nchurch or the state is in danger, if faith in the wisdom of\\nantiquity is not implicit; and they who, roused by the sight of\\nhuman calamity, dare to attack human authority, are reviled as\\ndespisers of God, and enemies of man.  These are bitter calumnies,\\nyet they reached one of the best of men, (Dr. Price.) whose ashes\\nstill preach peace, and whose memory demands a respectful pause,\\nwhen subjects are discussed that lay so near his heart.\\n\\nAfter attacking the sacred majesty of kings, I shall scarcely\\nexcite surprise, by adding my firm persuasion, that every\\nprofession, in which great subordination of rank constitutes its\\npower, is highly injurious to morality.\\n\\nA standing army, for instance, is incompatible with freedom;\\nbecause subordination and rigour are the very sinews of military\\ndiscipline; and despotism is necessary to give vigour to\\nenterprises that one will directs.  A spirit inspired by romantic\\nnotions of honour, a kind of morality founded on the fashion of the\\nage, can only be felt by a few officers, whilst the main body must\\nbe moved by command, like the waves of the sea; for the strong wind\\nof authority pushes the crowd of subalterns forward, they scarcely\\nknow or care why, with headlong fury.\\n\\nBesides, nothing can be so prejudicial to the morals of the\\ninhabitants of country towns, as the occasional residence of a set\\nof idle superficial young men, whose only occupation is gallantry,\\nand whose polished manners render vice more dangerous, by\\nconcealing its deformity under gay ornamental drapery.  An air of\\nfashion, which is but a badge of slavery, and proves that the soul\\nhas not a strong individual character, awes simple country people\\ninto an imitation of the vices, when they cannot catch the slippery\\ngraces of politeness.  Every corps is a chain of despots, who,\\nsubmitting and tyrannizing without exercising their reason, become\\ndead weights of vice and folly on the community.  A man of rank or\\nfortune, sure of rising by interest, has nothing to do but to\\npursue some extravagant freak; whilst the needy GENTLEMAN, who is\\nto rise, as the phrase turns, by his merit, becomes a servile\\nparasite or vile pander.\\n\\nSailors, the naval gentlemen, come under the same description, only\\ntheir vices assume a different and a grosser cast.  They are more\\npositively indolent, when not discharging the ceremonials of their\\nstation; whilst the insignificant fluttering of soldiers may be\\ntermed active idleness.  More confined to the society of men, the\\nformer acquire a fondness for humour and mischievous tricks; whilst\\nthe latter, mixing frequently with well-bred women, catch a\\nsentimental cant.  But mind is equally out of the question, whether\\nthey indulge the horse-laugh or polite simper.\\n\\nMay I be allowed to extend the comparison to a profession where\\nmore mind is certainly to be found; for the clergy have superior\\nopportunities of improvement, though subordination almost equally\\ncramps their faculties? The blind submission imposed at college to\\nforms of belief, serves as a noviciate to the curate who most\\nobsequiously respects the opinion of his rector or patron, if he\\nmeans to rise in his profession.  Perhaps there cannot be a more\\nforcible contrast than between the servile, dependent gait of a\\npoor curate, and the courtly mien of a bishop.  And the respect and\\ncontempt they inspire render the discharge of their separate\\nfunctions equally useless.\\n\\nIt is of great importance to observe, that the character of every\\nman is, in some degree, formed by his profession.  A man of sense\\nmay only have a cast of countenance that wears off as you trace his\\nindividuality, whilst the weak, common man, has scarcely ever any\\ncharacter, but what belongs to the body; at least, all his opinions\\nhave been so steeped in the vat consecrated by authority, that the\\nfaint spirit which the grape of his own vine yields cannot be\\ndistinguished.\\n\\nSociety, therefore, as it becomes more enlightened, should be very\\ncareful not to establish bodies of men who must necessarily be made\\nfoolish or vicious by the very constitution of their profession.\\n\\nIn the infancy of society, when men were just emerging out of\\nbarbarism, chiefs and priests, touching the most powerful springs\\nof savage conduct--hope and fear--must have had unbounded sway.  An\\naristocracy, of course, is naturally the first form of government.\\nBut clashing interests soon losing their equipoise, a monarchy and\\nhierarchy break out of the confusion of ambitious struggles, and\\nthe foundation of both is secured by feudal tenures.  This appears\\nto be the origin of monarchial and priestly power, and the dawn of\\ncivilization.  But such combustible materials cannot long be pent\\nup; and getting vent in foreign wars and intestine insurrections,\\nthe people acquire some power in the tumult, which obliges their\\nrulers to gloss over their oppression with a show of right.  Thus,\\nas wars, agriculture, commerce, and literature, expands the mind,\\ndespots are compelled, to make covert corruption hold fast the\\npower which was formerly snatched by open force.*  And this baneful\\nlurking gangrene is most quickly spread by luxury and superstition,\\nthe sure dregs of ambition.  The indolent puppet of a court first\\nbecomes a luxurious monster, or fastidious sensualist, and then\\nmakes the contagion which his unnatural state spreads, the\\ninstrument of tyranny.\\n\\n(*Footnote.  Men of abilities scatter seeds that grow up, and have\\na great influence on the forming opinion; and when once the public\\nopinion preponderates, through the exertion of reason, the\\noverthrow of arbitrary power is not very distant.)\\n\\nIt is the pestiferous purple which renders the progress of\\ncivilization a curse, and warps the understanding, till men of\\nsensibility doubt whether the expansion of intellect produces a\\ngreater portion of happiness or misery.  But the nature of the\\npoison points out the antidote; and had Rousseau mounted one step\\nhigher in his investigation; or could his eye have pierced through\\nthe foggy atmosphere, which he almost disdained to breathe, his\\nactive mind would have darted forward to contemplate the perfection\\nof man in the establishment of true civilization, instead of taking\\nhis ferocious flight back to the night of sensual ignorance.\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\n\\nThere seems to be an indolent propensity in man to make\\nprescription always take place of reason, and to place every duty\\non an arbitrary foundation.  The rights of kings are deduced in a\\ndirect line from the King of kings; and that of parents from our\\nfirst parent.\\n\\nWhy do we thus go back for principles that should always rest on\\nthe same base, and have the same weight to-day that they had a\\nthousand years ago--and not a jot more?  If parents discharge their\\nduty they have a strong hold and sacred claim on the gratitude of\\ntheir children; but few parents are willing to receive the\\nrespectful affection of their offspring on such terms.  They demand\\nblind obedience, because they do not merit a reasonable service:\\nand to render these demands of weakness and ignorance more binding,\\na mysterious sanctity is spread round the most arbitrary principle;\\nfor what other name can be given to the blind duty of obeying\\nvicious or weak beings, merely because they obeyed a powerful\\ninstinct? The simple definition of the reciprocal duty, which\\nnaturally subsists between parent and child, may be given in a few\\nwords:  The parent who pays proper attention to helpless infancy\\nhas a right to require the same attention when the feebleness of\\nage comes upon him.  But to subjugate a rational being to the mere\\nwill of another, after he is of age to answer to society for his\\nown conduct, is a most cruel and undue stretch of power; and\\nperhaps as injurious to morality, as those religious systems which\\ndo not allow right and wrong to have any existence, but in the\\nDivine will.\\n\\nI never knew a parent who had paid more than common attention to\\nhis children, disregarded (Dr. Johnson makes the same\\nobservation.); on the contrary, the early habit of relying almost\\nimplicitly on the opinion of a respected parent is not easily\\nshaken, even when matured reason convinces the child that his\\nfather is not the wisest man in the world.  This weakness, for a\\nweakness it is, though the epithet AMIABLE may be tacked to it, a\\nreasonable man must steel himself against; for the absurd duty, too\\noften inculcated, of obeying a parent only on account of his being\\na parent, shackles the mind, and prepares it for a slavish\\nsubmission to any power but reason.\\n\\nI distinguish between the natural and accidental duty due to\\nparents.\\n\\nThe parent who sedulously endeavours to form the heart and enlarge\\nthe understanding of his child, has given that dignity to the\\ndischarge of a duty, common to the whole animal world, that only\\nreason can give.  This is the parental affection of humanity, and\\nleaves instinctive natural affection far behind.  Such a parent\\nacquires all the rights of the most sacred friendship, and his\\nadvice, even when his child is advanced in life, demands serious\\nconsideration.\\n\\nWith respect to marriage, though after one and twenty a parent\\nseems to have no right to withhold his consent on any account; yet\\ntwenty years of solicitude call for a return, and the son ought, at\\nleast, to promise not to marry for two or three years, should the\\nobject of his choice not entirely meet with the approbation of his\\nfirst friend.\\n\\nBut, respect for parents is, generally speaking, a much more\\ndebasing principle; it is only a selfish respect for property.  The\\nfather who is blindly obeyed, is obeyed from sheer weakness, or\\nfrom motives that degrade the human character.\\n\\nA great proportion of the misery that wanders, in hideous forms\\naround the world, is allowed to rise from the negligence of\\nparents; and still these are the people who are most tenacious of\\nwhat they term a natural right, though it be subversive of the\\nbirth right of man, the right of acting according to the direction\\nof his own reason.\\n\\nI have already very frequently had occasion to observe, that\\nvicious or indolent people are always eager to profit by enforcing\\narbitrary privileges; and generally in the same proportion as they\\nneglect the discharge of the duties which alone render the\\nprivileges reasonable.  This is at the bottom, a dictate of common\\nsense, or the instinct of self-defence, peculiar to ignorant\\nweakness; resembling that instinct, which makes a fish muddy the\\nwater it swims in to elude its enemy, instead of boldly facing it\\nin the clear stream.\\n\\n>From the clear stream of argument, indeed, the supporters of\\nprescription, of every denomination, fly:  and taking refuge in the\\ndarkness, which, in the language of sublime poetry, has been\\nsupposed to surround the throne of Omnipotence, they dare to demand\\nthat implicit respect which is only due to His unsearchable ways.\\nBut, let me not be thought presumptuous, the darkness which hides\\nour God from us, only respects speculative truths-- it never\\nobscures moral ones, they shine clearly, for God is light, and\\nnever, by the constitution of our nature, requires the discharge of\\na duty, the reasonableness of which does not beam on us when we\\nopen our eyes.\\n\\nThe indolent parent of high rank may, it is true, extort a show of\\nrespect from his child, and females on the continent are\\nparticularly subject to the views of their families, who never\\nthink of consulting their inclination, or providing for the comfort\\nof the poor victims of their pride.  The consequence is notorious;\\nthese dutiful daughters become adulteresses, and neglect the\\neducation of their children, from whom they, in their turn, exact\\nthe same kind of obedience.\\n\\nFemales, it is true, in all countries, are too much under the\\ndominion of their parents; and few parents think of addressing\\ntheir children in the following manner, though it is in this\\nreasonable way that Heaven seems to command the whole human race.\\nIt is your interest to obey me till you can judge for yourself; and\\nthe Almighty Father of all has implanted an affection in me to\\nserve as a guard to you whilst your reason is unfolding; but when\\nyour mind arrives at maturity, you must only obey me, or rather\\nrespect my opinions, so far as they coincide with the light that is\\nbreaking in on your own mind.\\n\\nA slavish bondage to parents cramps every faculty of the mind; and\\nMr. Locke very judiciously observes, that \"if the mind be curbed\\nand humbled too much in children; if their spirits be abased and\\nbroken much by too strict an hand over them; they lose all their\\nvigour and industry.\"  This strict hand may, in some degree,\\naccount for the weakness of women; for girls, from various causes,\\nare more kept down by their parents, in every sense of the word,\\nthan boys.  The duty expected from them is, like all the duties\\narbitrarily imposed on women, more from a sense of propriety, more\\nout of respect for decorum, than reason; and thus taught slavishly\\nto submit to their parents, they are prepared for the slavery of\\nmarriage.  I may be told that a number of women are not slaves in\\nthe marriage state.  True, but they then become tyrants; for it is\\nnot rational freedom, but a lawless kind of power, resembling the\\nauthority exercised by the favourites of absolute monarchs, which\\nthey obtain by debasing means.  I do not, likewise, dream of\\ninsinuating that either boys or girls are always slaves, I only\\ninsist, that when they are obliged to submit to authority blindly,\\ntheir faculties are weakened, and their tempers rendered imperious\\nor abject.  I also lament, that parents, indolently availing\\nthemselves of a supposed privilege, damp the first faint glimmering\\nof reason rendering at the same time the duty, which they are so\\nanxious to enforce, an empty name; because they will not let it\\nrest on the only basis on which a duty can rest securely:  for,\\nunless it be founded on knowledge, it cannot gain sufficient\\nstrength to resist the squalls of passion, or the silent sapping of\\nself-love.  But it is not the parents who have given the surest\\nproof of their affection for their children, (or, to speak more\\nproperly, who by fulfilling their duty, have allowed a natural\\nparental affection to take root in their hearts, the child of\\nexercised sympathy and reason, and not the over-weening offspring\\nof selfish pride,) who most vehemently insist on their children\\nsubmitting to their will, merely because it is their will.  On the\\ncontrary, the parent who sets a good example, patiently lets that\\nexample work; and it seldom fails to produce its natural\\neffect--filial respect.\\n\\nChildren cannot be taught too early to submit to reason, the true\\ndefinition of that necessity, which Rousseau insisted on, without\\ndefining it; for to submit to reason, is to submit to the nature of\\nthings, and to that God who formed them so, to promote our real\\ninterest.\\n\\nWhy should the minds of children be warped as they just begin to\\nexpand, only to favour the indolence of parents, who insist on a\\nprivilege without being willing to pay the price fixed by nature?\\nI have before had occasion to observe, that a right always includes\\na duty, and I think it may, likewise fairly be inferred, that they\\nforfeit the right, who do not fulfil the duty.\\n\\nIt is easier, I grant, to command than reason; but it does not\\nfollow from hence, that children cannot comprehend the reason why\\nthey are made to do certain things habitually; for, from a steady\\nadherence to a few simple principles of conduct flows that salutary\\npower, which a judicious parent gradually gains over a child\\'s\\nmind.  And this power becomes strong indeed, if tempered by an even\\ndisplay of affection brought home to the child\\'s heart.  For, I\\nbelieve, as a general rule, it must be allowed, that the affection\\nwhich we inspire always resembles that we cultivate; so that\\nnatural affections, which have been supposed almost distinct from\\nreason, may be found more nearly connected with judgment than is\\ncommonly allowed.  Nay, as another proof of the necessity of\\ncultivating the female understanding, it is but just to observe,\\nthat the affections seem to have a kind of animal capriciousness\\nwhen they merely reside in the heart.\\n\\nIt is the irregular exercise of parental authority that first\\ninjures the mind, and to these irregularities girls are more\\nsubject than boys.  The will of those who never allow their will to\\nbe disputed, unless they happen to be in a good humour, when they\\nrelax proportionally, is almost always unreasonable.  To elude this\\narbitrary authority, girls very early learn the lessons which they\\nafterwards practise on their husbands; for I have frequently seen a\\nlittle sharp-faced miss rule a whole family, excepting that now and\\nthen mamma\\'s anger will burst out of some accidental cloud-- either\\nher hair was ill-dressed,* or she had lost more money at cards, the\\nnight before, than she was willing to own to her husband; or some\\nsuch moral cause of anger.\\n\\n(*Footnote.  I myself heard a little girl once say to a servant,\\n\"My mamma has been scolding me finely this morning, because her\\nhair was not dressed to please her.\"  Though this remark was pert,\\nit was just.  And what respect could a girl acquire for such a\\nparent, without doing violence to reason?)\\n\\nAfter observing sallies of this kind, I have been led into a\\nmelancholy train of reflection respecting females, concluding that\\nwhen their first affection must lead them astray, or make their\\nduties clash till they rest on mere whims and customs, little can\\nbe expected from them as they advance in life.  How, indeed, can an\\ninstructor remedy this evil? for to teach them virtue on any solid\\nprinciple is to teach them to despise their parents.  Children\\ncannot, ought not to be taught to make allowance for the faults of\\ntheir parents, because every such allowance weakens the force of\\nreason in their minds, and makes them still more indulgent to their\\nown.  It is one of the most sublime virtues of maturity that leads\\nus to be severe with respect to ourselves, and forbearing to\\nothers; but children should only be taught the simple virtues, for\\nif they begin too early to make allowance for human passions and\\nmanners, they wear off the fine edge of the criterion by which they\\nshould regulate their own, and become unjust in the same proportion\\nas they grow indulgent.\\n\\nThe affections of children, and weak people, are always selfish;\\nthey love others, because others love them, and not on account of\\ntheir virtues.  Yet, till esteem and love are blended together in\\nthe first affection, and reason made the foundation of the first\\nduty, morality will stumble at the threshold.  But, till society is\\nvery differently constituted, parents, I fear, will still insist on\\nbeing obeyed, because they will be obeyed, and constantly endeavour\\nto settle that power on a Divine right, which will not bear the\\ninvestigation of reason.\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nThat woman is naturally weak, or degraded by a concurrence of\\ncircumstances is, I think, clear.  But this position I shall simply\\ncontrast with a conclusion, which I have frequently heard fall from\\nsensible men in favour of an aristocracy:  that the mass of mankind\\ncannot be any thing, or the obsequious slaves, who patiently allow\\nthemselves to be penned up, would feel their own consequence, and\\nspurn their chains.  Men, they further observe, submit every where\\nto oppression, when they have only to lift up their heads to throw\\noff the yoke; yet, instead of asserting their birthright, they\\nquietly lick the dust, and say, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow\\nwe die.  Women, I argue from analogy, are degraded by the same\\npropensity to enjoy the present moment; and, at last, despise the\\nfreedom which they have not sufficient virtue to struggle to\\nattain.  But I must be more explicit.\\n\\nWith respect to the culture of the heart, it is unanimously allowed\\nthat sex is out of the question; but the line of subordination in\\nthe mental powers is never to be passed over.  Only \"absolute in\\nloveliness,\" the portion of rationality granted to woman is,\\nindeed, very scanty; for, denying her genius and judgment, it is\\nscarcely possible to divine what remains to characterize intellect.\\n\\nThe stamina of immortality, if I may be allowed the phrase, is the\\nperfectibility of human reason; for, was man created perfect, or\\ndid a flood of knowledge break in upon him, when he arrived at\\nmaturity, that precluded error, I should doubt whether his\\nexistence would be continued after the dissolution of the body.\\nBut in the present state of things, every difficulty in morals,\\nthat escapes from human discussion, and equally baffles the\\ninvestigation of profound thinking, and the lightning glance of\\ngenius, is an argument on which I build my belief of the\\nimmortality of the soul.  Reason is, consequentially, the simple\\npower of improvement; or, more properly speaking, of discerning\\ntruth.  Every individual is in this respect a world in itself.\\nMore or less may be conspicuous in one being than other; but the\\nnature of reason must be the same in all, if it be an emanation of\\ndivinity, the tie that connects the creature with the Creator; for,\\ncan that soul be stamped with the heavenly image, that is not\\nperfected by the exercise of its own reason?  Yet outwardly\\nornamented with elaborate care, and so adorned to delight man,\\n\"that with honour he may love,\" (Vide Milton) the soul of woman is\\nnot allowed to have this distinction, and man, ever placed between\\nher and reason, she is always represented as only created to see\\nthrough a gross medium, and to take things on trust.  But,\\ndismissing these fanciful theories, and considering woman as a\\nwhole, let it be what it will, instead of a part of man, the\\ninquiry is, whether she has reason or not.  If she has, which, for\\na moment, I will take for granted, she was not created merely to be\\nthe solace of man, and the sexual should not destroy the human\\ncharacter.\\n\\nInto this error men have, probably, been led by viewing education\\nin a false light; not considering it as the first step to form a\\nbeing advancing gradually toward perfection; (This word is not\\nstrictly just, but I cannot find a better.) but only as a\\npreparation for life.  On this sensual error, for I must call it\\nso, has the false system of female manners been reared, which robs\\nthe whole sex of its dignity, and classes the brown and fair with\\nthe smiling flowers that only adorn the land.  This has ever been\\nthe language of men, and the fear of departing from a supposed\\nsexual character, has made even women of superior sense adopt the\\nsame sentiments.  Thus understanding, strictly speaking, has been\\ndenied to woman; and instinct, sublimated into wit and cunning, for\\nthe purposes of life, has been substituted in its stead.\\n\\nThe power of generalizing ideas, of drawing comprehensive\\nconclusions from individual observations, is the only acquirement\\nfor an immortal being, that really deserves the name of knowledge.\\nMerely to observe, without endeavouring to account for any thing,\\nmay, (in a very incomplete manner) serve as the common sense of\\nlife; but where is the store laid up that is to clothe the soul\\nwhen it leaves the body?\\n\\nThis power has not only been denied to women; but writers have\\ninsisted that it is inconsistent, with a few exceptions, with their\\nsexual character.  Let men prove this, and I shall grant that woman\\nonly exists for man.  I must, however, previously remark, that the\\npower of generalizing ideas, to any great extent, is not very\\ncommon amongst men or women.  But this exercise is the true\\ncultivation of the understanding; and every thing conspires to\\nrender the cultivation of the understanding more difficult in the\\nfemale than the male world.\\n\\nI am naturally led by this assertion to the main subject of the\\npresent chapter, and shall now attempt to point out some of the\\ncauses that degrade the sex, and prevent women from generalizing\\ntheir observations.\\n\\nI shall not go back to the remote annals of antiquity to trace the\\nhistory of woman; it is sufficient to allow, that she has always\\nbeen either a slave or a despot, and to remark, that each of these\\nsituations equally retards the progress of reason.  The grand\\nsource of female folly and vice has ever appeared to me to arise\\nfrom narrowness of mind; and the very constitution of civil\\ngovernments has put almost insuperable obstacles in the way to\\nprevent the cultivation of the female understanding:  yet virtue\\ncan be built on no other foundation!  The same obstacles are thrown\\nin the way of the rich, and the same consequences ensue.\\n\\nNecessity has been proverbially termed the mother of invention; the\\naphorism may be extended to virtue.  It is an acquirement, and an\\nacquirement to which pleasure must be sacrificed, and who\\nsacrifices pleasure when it is within the grasp, whose mind has not\\nbeen opened and strengthened by adversity, or the pursuit of\\nknowledge goaded on by necessity?  Happy is it when people have the\\ncares of life to struggle with; for these struggles prevent their\\nbecoming a prey to enervating vices, merely from idleness!  But, if\\nfrom their birth men and women are placed in a torrid zone, with\\nthe meridian sun of pleasure darting directly upon them, how can\\nthey sufficiently brace their minds to discharge the duties of\\nlife, or even to relish the affections that carry them out of\\nthemselves?\\n\\nPleasure is the business of a woman\\'s life, according to the\\npresent modification of society, and while it continues to be so,\\nlittle can be expected from such weak beings.  Inheriting, in a\\nlineal descent from the first fair defect in nature, the\\nsovereignty of beauty, they have, to maintain their power, resigned\\ntheir natural rights, which the exercise of reason, might have\\nprocured them, and chosen rather to be short-lived queens than\\nlabour to attain the sober pleasures that arise from equality.\\nExalted by their inferiority (this sounds like a contradiction)\\nthey constantly demand homage as women, though experience should\\nteach them that the men who pride themselves upon paying this\\narbitrary insolent respect to the sex, with the most scrupulous\\nexactness, are most inclined to tyrannize over, and despise the\\nvery weakness they cherish.  Often do they repeat Mr. Hume\\'s\\nsentiments; when comparing the French and Athenian character, he\\nalludes to women.  \"But what is more singular in this whimsical\\nnation, say I to the Athenians, is, that a frolic of yours during\\nthe Saturnalia, when the slaves are served by their masters, is\\nseriously continued by them through the whole year, and through the\\nwhole course of their lives; accompanied too with some\\ncircumstances, which still further augment the absurdity and\\nridicule.  Your sport only elevates for a few days, those whom\\nfortune has thrown down, and whom she too, in sport, may really\\nelevate forever above you.  But this nation gravely exalts those,\\nwhom nature has subjected to them, and whose inferiority and\\ninfirmities are absolutely incurable.  The women, though without\\nvirtue, are their masters and sovereigns.\"\\n\\nAh! why do women, I write with affectionate solicitude, condescend\\nto receive a degree of attention and respect from strangers,\\ndifferent from that reciprocation of civility which the dictates of\\nhumanity, and the politeness of civilization authorise between man\\nand man?  And why do they not discover, when \"in the noon of\\nbeauty\\'s power,\" that they are treated like queens only to be\\ndeluded by hollow respect, till they are led to resign, or not\\nassume, their natural prerogatives?  Confined then in cages, like\\nthe feathered race, they have nothing to do but to plume\\nthemselves, and stalk with mock-majesty from perch to perch.  It is\\ntrue, they are provided with food and raiment, for which they\\nneither toil nor spin; but health, liberty, and virtue are given in\\nexchange.  But, where, amongst mankind has been found sufficient\\nstrength of mind to enable a being to resign these adventitious\\nprerogatives; one who rising with the calm dignity of reason above\\nopinion, dared to be proud of the privileges inherent in man? and\\nit is vain to expect it whilst hereditary power chokes the\\naffections, and nips reason in the bud.\\n\\nThe passions of men have thus placed women on thrones; and, till\\nmankind become more reasonable, it is to be feared that women will\\navail themselves of the power which they attain with the least\\nexertion, and which is the most indisputable.  They will smile,\\nyes, they will smile, though told that--\\n\\n\"In beauty\\'s empire is no mean,\\nAnd woman either slave or queen,\\nIs quickly scorn\\'d when not ador\\'d.\"\\n\\nBut the adoration comes first, and the scorn is not anticipated.\\n\\nLewis the XIVth, in particular, spread factitious manners, and\\ncaught in a specious way, the whole nation in his toils; for\\nestablishing an artful chain of despotism, he made it the interest\\nof the people at large, individually to respect his station, and\\nsupport his power.  And women, whom he flattered by a puerile\\nattention to the whole sex, obtained in his reign that prince-like\\ndistinction so fatal to reason and virtue.\\n\\nA king is always a king, and a woman always a woman: (And a wit,\\nalways a wit, might be added; for the vain fooleries of wits and\\nbeauties to obtain attention, and make conquests, are much upon a\\npar.)  his authority and her sex, ever stand between them and\\nrational converse.  With a lover, I grant she should be so, and her\\nsensibility will naturally lead her to endeavour to excite emotion,\\nnot to gratify her vanity but her heart.  This I do not allow to be\\ncoquetry, it is the artless impulse of nature, I only exclaim\\nagainst the sexual desire of conquest, when the heart is out of the\\nquestion.\\n\\nThis desire is not confined to women; \"I have endeavoured,\" says\\nLord Chesterfield, \"to gain the hearts of twenty women, whose\\npersons I would not have given a fig for.\"  The libertine who in a\\ngust of passion, takes advantage of unsuspecting tenderness, is a\\nsaint when compared with this cold-hearted rascal; for I like to\\nuse significant words.  Yet only taught to please, women are always\\non the watch to please, and with true heroic ardour endeavour to\\ngain hearts merely to resign, or spurn them, when the victory is\\ndecided, and conspicuous.\\n\\nI must descend to the minutiae of the subject.\\n\\nI lament that women are systematically degraded by receiving the\\ntrivial attentions, which men think it manly to pay to the sex,\\nwhen, in fact, they are insultingly supporting their own\\nsuperiority.  It is not condescension to bow to an inferior.  So\\nludicrous, in fact, do these ceremonies appear to me, that I\\nscarcely am able to govern my muscles, when I see a man start with\\neager, and serious solicitude to lift a handkerchief, or shut a\\ndoor, when the LADY could have done it herself, had she only moved\\na pace or two.\\n\\nA wild wish has just flown from my heart to my head, and I will not\\nstifle it though it may excite a horse laugh.  I do earnestly wish\\nto see the distinction of sex confounded in society, unless where\\nlove animates the behaviour.  For this distinction is, I am firmly\\npersuaded, the foundation of the weakness of character ascribed to\\nwoman; is the cause why the understanding is neglected, whilst\\naccomplishments are acquired with sedulous care:  and the same\\ncause accounts for their preferring the graceful before the heroic\\nvirtues.\\n\\nMankind, including every description, wish to be loved and\\nrespected for SOMETHING; and the common herd will always take the\\nnearest road to the completion of their wishes.  The respect paid\\nto wealth and beauty is the most certain and unequivocal; and of\\ncourse, will always attract the vulgar eye of common minds.\\nAbilities and virtues are absolutely necessary to raise men from\\nthe middle rank of life into notice; and the natural consequence is\\nnotorious, the middle rank contains most virtue and abilities.  Men\\nhave thus, in one station, at least, an opportunity of exerting\\nthemselves with dignity, and of rising by the exertions which\\nreally improve a rational creature; but the whole female sex are,\\ntill their character is formed, in the same condition as the rich:\\nfor they are born, I now speak of a state of civilization, with\\ncertain sexual privileges, and whilst they are gratuitously granted\\nthem, few will ever think of works of supererogation, to obtain the\\nesteem of a small number of superior people.\\n\\nWhen do we hear of women, who starting out of obscurity, boldly\\nclaim respect on account of their great abilities or daring\\nvirtues?  Where are they to be found?  \"To be observed, to be\\nattended to, to be taken notice of with sympathy, complacency, and\\napprobation, are all the advantages which they seek.\"  True! my\\nmale readers will probably exclaim; but let them, before they draw\\nany conclusion, recollect, that this was not written originally as\\ndescriptive of women, but of the rich.  In Dr. Smith\\'s Theory of\\nMoral Sentiments, I have found a general character of people of\\nrank and fortune, that in my opinion, might with the greatest\\npropriety be applied to the female sex.  I refer the sagacious\\nreader to the whole comparison; but must be allowed to quote a\\npassage to enforce an argument that I mean to insist on, as the one\\nmost conclusive against a sexual character.  For if, excepting\\nwarriors, no great men of any denomination, have ever appeared\\namongst the nobility, may it not be fairly inferred, that their\\nlocal situation swallowed up the man, and produced a character\\nsimilar to that of women, who are LOCALIZED, if I may be allowed\\nthe word, by the rank they are placed in, by COURTESY?  Women,\\ncommonly called Ladies, are not to be contradicted in company, are\\nnot allowed to exert any manual strength; and from them the\\nnegative virtues only are expected, when any virtues are expected,\\npatience, docility, good-humour, and flexibility; virtues\\nincompatible with any vigorous exertion of intellect.  Besides by\\nliving more with each other, and to being seldom absolutely alone,\\nthey are more under the influence of sentiments than passions.\\nSolitude and reflection are necessary to give to wishes the force\\nof passions, and enable the imagination to enlarge the object and\\nmake it the most desirable.  The same may be said of the rich; they\\ndo not sufficiently deal in general ideas, collected by\\nimpassionate thinking, or calm investigation, to acquire that\\nstrength of character, on which great resolves are built.  But hear\\nwhat an acute observer says of the great.\\n\\n\"Do the great seem insensible of the easy price at which they may\\nacquire the public admiration? or do they seem to imagine, that to\\nthem, as to other men, it must be the purchase either of sweat or\\nof blood?  By what important accomplishments is the young nobleman\\ninstructed to support the dignity of his rank, and to render\\nhimself worthy of that superiority over his fellow citizens, to\\nwhich the virtue of his ancestors had raised them? Is it by\\nknowledge, by industry, by patience, by self-denial, or by virtue\\nof any kind?  As all his words, as all his motions are attended to,\\nhe learns an habitual regard for every circumstance of ordinary\\nbehaviour, and studies to perform all those small duties with the\\nmost exact propriety.  As he is conscious how much he is observed,\\nand how much mankind are disposed to favour all his inclinations,\\nhe acts, upon the most indifferent occasions, with that freedom and\\nelevation which the thought of this naturally inspires.  His air,\\nhis manner, his deportment all mark that elegant and graceful sense\\nof his own superiority, which those who are born to an inferior\\nstation can hardly ever arrive at.  These are the arts by which he\\nproposes to make mankind more easily submit to his authority, and\\nto govern their inclinations according to his own pleasure:  and in\\nthis he is seldom disappointed.  These arts, supported by rank and\\npre-eminence, are, upon ordinary occasions, sufficient to govern\\nthe world.  Lewis XIV. during the greater part of his reign, was\\nregarded, not only in France, but over all Europe, as the most\\nperfect model of a great prince.  But what were the talents and\\nvirtues, by which he acquired this great reputation? Was it by the\\nscrupulous and inflexible justice of all his undertakings, by the\\nimmense dangers and difficulties with which they were attended, or\\nby the unwearied and unrelenting application with which he pursued\\nthem?  Was it by his extensive knowledge, by his exquisite\\njudgment, or by his heroic valour?  It was by none of these\\nqualities.  But he was, first of all, the most powerful prince in\\nEurope, and consequently held the highest rank among kings; and\\nthen, says his historian, \\'he surpassed all his courtiers in the\\ngracefulness of his shape, and the majestic beauty of his features.\\nThe sound of his voice noble and affecting, gained those hearts\\nwhich his presence intimidated.  He had a step and a deportment,\\nwhich could suit only him and his rank, and which would have been\\nridiculous in any other person.  The embarrassment which he\\noccasioned to those who spoke to him, flattered that secret\\nsatisfaction with which he felt his own superiority.\\' These\\nfrivolous accomplishments, supported by his rank, and, no doubt,\\ntoo, by a degree of other talents and virtues, which seems,\\nhowever, not to have been much above mediocrity, established this\\nprince in the esteem of his own age, and have drawn even from\\nposterity, a good deal of respect for his memory.  Compared with\\nthese, in his own times, and in his own presence, no other virtue,\\nit seems, appeared to have any merit.  Knowledge, industry, valour,\\nand beneficence, trembling, were abashed, and lost all dignity\\nbefore them.\"\\n\\nWoman, also, thus \"in herself complete,\" by possessing all these\\nFRIVOLOUS accomplishments, so changes the nature of things,\\n\\n--\"That what she wills to do or say\\nSeems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best;\\nAll higher knowledge in HER PRESENCE falls\\nDegraded.  Wisdom in discourse with her\\nLoses discountenanc\\'d, and like folly shows;\\nAuthority and reason on her wait.\"--\\n\\nAnd all this is built on her loveliness!\\n\\nIn the middle rank of life, to continue the comparison, men, in\\ntheir youth, are prepared for professions, and marriage is not\\nconsidered as the grand feature in their lives; whilst women, on\\nthe contrary, have no other scheme to sharpen their faculties.  It\\nis not business, extensive plans, or any of the excursive flights\\nof ambition, that engross their attention; no, their thoughts are\\nnot employed in rearing such noble structures.  To rise in the\\nworld, and have the liberty of running from pleasure to pleasure,\\nthey must marry advantageously, and to this object their time is\\nsacrificed, and their persons often legally prostituted.  A man,\\nwhen he enters any profession, has his eye steadily fixed on some\\nfuture advantage (and the mind gains great strength by having all\\nits efforts directed to one point) and, full of his business,\\npleasure is considered as mere relaxation; whilst women seek for\\npleasure as the main purpose of existence.  In fact, from the\\neducation which they receive from society, the love of pleasure may\\nbe said to govern them all; but does this prove that there is a sex\\nin souls?  It would be just as rational to declare, that the\\ncourtiers in France, when a destructive system of despotism had\\nformed their character, were not men, because liberty, virtue, and\\nhumanity, were sacrificed to pleasure and vanity.  Fatal passions,\\nwhich have ever domineered over the WHOLE race!\\n\\nThe same love of pleasure, fostered by the whole tendency of their\\neducation, gives a trifling turn to the conduct of women in most\\ncircumstances:  for instance, they are ever anxious about secondary\\nthings; and on the watch for adventures, instead of being occupied\\nby duties.\\n\\nA man, when he undertakes a journey, has, in general the end in\\nview; a woman thinks more of the incidental occurrences, the\\nstrange things that may possibly occur on the road; the impression\\nthat she may make on her fellow travellers; and, above all, she is\\nanxiously intent on the care of the finery that she carries with\\nher, which is more than ever a part of herself, when going to\\nfigure on a new scene; when, to use an apt French turn of\\nexpression, she is going to produce a sensation.  Can dignity of\\nmind exist with such trivial cares?\\n\\nIn short, women, in general, as well as the rich of both sexes,\\nhave acquired all the follies and vices of civilization, and missed\\nthe useful fruit.  It is not necessary for me always to premise,\\nthat I speak of the condition of the whole sex, leaving exceptions\\nout of the question.  Their senses are inflamed, and their\\nunderstandings neglected; consequently they become the prey of\\ntheir senses, delicately termed sensibility, and are blown about by\\nevery momentary gust of feeling.  They are, therefore, in a much\\nworse condition than they would be in, were they in a state nearer\\nto nature.  Ever restless and anxious, their over exercised\\nsensibility not only renders them uncomfortable themselves, but\\ntroublesome, to use a soft phrase, to others.  All their thoughts\\nturn on things calculated to excite emotion; and, feeling, when\\nthey should reason, their conduct is unstable, and their opinions\\nare wavering, not the wavering produced by deliberation or\\nprogressive views, but by contradictory emotions.  By fits and\\nstarts they are warm in many pursuits; yet this warmth, never\\nconcentrated into perseverance, soon exhausts itself; exhaled by\\nits own heat, or meeting with some other fleeting passion, to which\\nreason has never given any specific gravity, neutrality ensues.\\nMiserable, indeed, must be that being whose cultivation of mind has\\nonly tended to inflame its passions!  A distinction should be made\\nbetween inflaming and strengthening them.  The passions thus\\npampered, whilst the judgment is left unformed, what can be\\nexpected to ensue?  Undoubtedly, a mixture of madness and folly!\\n\\nThis observation should not be confined to the FAIR sex; however,\\nat present, I only mean to apply it to them.\\n\\nNovels, music, poetry and gallantry, all tend to make women the\\ncreatures of sensation, and their character is thus formed during\\nthe time they are acquiring accomplishments, the only improvement\\nthey are excited, by their station in society, to acquire.  This\\noverstretched sensibility naturally relaxes the other powers of the\\nmind, and prevents intellect from attaining that sovereignty which\\nit ought to attain, to render a rational creature useful to others,\\nand content with its own station; for the exercise of the\\nunderstanding, as life advances, is the only method pointed out by\\nnature to calm the passions.\\n\\nSatiety has a very different effect, and I have often been forcibly\\nstruck by an emphatical description of damnation, when the spirit\\nis represented as continually hovering with abortive eagerness\\nround the defiled body, unable to enjoy any thing without the\\norgans of sense.  Yet, to their senses, are women made slaves,\\nbecause it is by their sensibility that they obtain present power.\\n\\nAnd will moralists pretend to assert, that this is the condition in\\nwhich one half of the human race should be encouraged to remain\\nwith listless inactivity and stupid acquiescence?  Kind\\ninstructors! what were we created for?  To remain, it may be said,\\ninnocent; they mean in a state of childhood.  We might as well\\nnever have been born, unless it were necessary that we should be\\ncreated to enable man to acquire the noble privilege of reason, the\\npower of discerning good from evil, whilst we lie down in the dust\\nfrom whence we were taken, never to rise again.\\n\\nIt would be an endless task to trace the variety of meannesses,\\ncares, and sorrows, into which women are plunged by the prevailing\\nopinion, that they were created rather to feel than reason, and\\nthat all the power they obtain, must be obtained by their charms\\nand weakness;\\n\\n\"Fine by defect, and amiably weak!\"\\n\\nAnd, made by this amiable weakness entirely dependent, excepting\\nwhat they gain by illicit sway, on man, not only for protection,\\nbut advice, is it surprising that, neglecting the duties that\\nreason alone points out, and shrinking from trials calculated to\\nstrengthen their minds, they only exert themselves to give their\\ndefects a graceful covering, which may serve to heighten their\\ncharms in the eye of the voluptuary, though it sink them below the\\nscale of moral excellence?\\n\\nFragile in every sense of the word, they are obliged to look up to\\nman for every comfort.  In the most trifling dangers they cling to\\ntheir support, with parasitical tenacity, piteously demanding\\nsuccour; and their NATURAL protector extends his arm, or lifts up\\nhis voice, to guard the lovely trembler--from what?  Perhaps the\\nfrown of an old cow, or the jump of a mouse; a rat, would be a\\nserious danger.  In the name of reason, and even common sense, what\\ncan save such beings from contempt; even though they be soft and\\nfair?\\n\\nThese fears, when not affected, may be very pretty; but they shew a\\ndegree of imbecility, that degrades a rational creature in a way\\nwomen are not aware of--for love and esteem are very distinct\\nthings.\\n\\nI am fully persuaded, that we should hear of none of these\\ninfantine airs, if girls were allowed to take sufficient exercise\\nand not confined in close rooms till their muscles are relaxed and\\ntheir powers of digestion destroyed.  To carry the remark still\\nfurther, if fear in girls, instead of being cherished, perhaps,\\ncreated, were treated in the same manner as cowardice in boys, we\\nshould quickly see women with more dignified aspects.  It is true,\\nthey could not then with equal propriety be termed the sweet\\nflowers that smile in the walk of man; but they would be more\\nrespectable members of society, and discharge the important duties\\nof life by the light of their own reason.  \"Educate women like\\nmen,\" says Rousseau, \"and the more they resemble our sex the less\\npower will they have over us.\"  This is the very point I aim at.  I\\ndo not wish them to have power over men; but over themselves.\\n\\nIn the same strain have I heard men argue against instructing the\\npoor; for many are the forms that aristocracy assumes.  \"Teach them\\nto read and write,\" say they, \"and you take them out of the station\\nassigned them by nature.\"  An eloquent Frenchman, has answered\\nthem; I will borrow his sentiments.  But they know not, when they\\nmake man a brute, that they may expect every instant to see him\\ntransformed into a ferocious beast.  Without knowledge there can be\\nno morality!\\n\\nIgnorance is a frail base for virtue!  Yet, that it is the\\ncondition for which woman was organized, has been insisted upon by\\nthe writers who have most vehemently argued in favour of the\\nsuperiority of man; a superiority not in degree, but essence;\\nthough, to soften the argument, they have laboured to prove, with\\nchivalrous generosity, that the sexes ought not to be compared; man\\nwas made to reason, woman to feel:  and that together, flesh and\\nspirit, they make the most perfect whole, by blending happily\\nreason and sensibility into one character.\\n\\nAnd what is sensibility?  \"Quickness of sensation; quickness of\\nperception; delicacy.\"  Thus is it defined by Dr. Johnson; and the\\ndefinition gives me no other idea than of the most exquisitely\\npolished instinct.  I discern not a trace of the image of God in\\neither sensation or matter.  Refined seventy times seven, they are\\nstill material; intellect dwells not there; nor will fire ever make\\nlead gold!\\n\\nI come round to my old argument; if woman be allowed to have an\\nimmortal soul, she must have as the employment of life, an\\nunderstanding to improve.  And when, to render the present state\\nmore complete, though every thing proves it to be but a fraction of\\na mighty sum, she is incited by present gratification to forget her\\ngrand destination.  Nature is counteracted, or she was born only to\\nprocreate and rot.  Or, granting brutes, of every description, a\\nsoul, though not a reasonable one, the exercise of instinct and\\nsensibility may be the step, which they are to take, in this life,\\ntowards the attainment of reason in the next; so that through all\\neternity they will lag behind man, who, why we cannot tell, had the\\npower given him of attaining reason in his first mode of existence.\\n\\nWhen I treat of the peculiar duties of women, as I should treat of\\nthe peculiar duties of a citizen or father, it will be found that I\\ndo not mean to insinuate, that they should be taken out of their\\nfamilies, speaking of the majority.  \"He that hath wife and\\nchildren,\" says Lord Bacon, \"hath given hostages to fortune; for\\nthey are impediments to great enterprises, either of virtue or\\nmischief.  Certainly the best works, and of greatest merit for the\\npublic, have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men.\" I say\\nthe same of women.  But, the welfare of society is not built on\\nextraordinary exertions; and were it more reasonably organized,\\nthere would be still less need of great abilities, or heroic\\nvirtues.  In the regulation of a family, in the education of\\nchildren, understanding, in an unsophisticated sense, is\\nparticularly required:  strength both of body and mind; yet the men\\nwho, by their writings, have most earnestly laboured to domesticate\\nwomen, have endeavoured by arguments dictated by a gross appetite,\\nthat satiety had rendered fastidious, to weaken their bodies and\\ncramp their minds.  But, if even by these sinister methods they\\nreally PERSUADED women, by working on their feelings, to stay at\\nhome, and fulfil the duties of a mother and mistress of a family, I\\nshould cautiously oppose opinions that led women to right conduct,\\nby prevailing on them to make the discharge of a duty the business\\nof life, though reason were insulted.  Yet, and I appeal to\\nexperience, if by neglecting the understanding they are as much,\\nnay, more attached from these domestic duties, than they could be\\nby the most serious intellectual pursuit, though it may be\\nobserved, that the mass of mankind will never vigorously pursue an\\nintellectual object, I may be allowed to infer, that reason is\\nabsolutely necessary to enable a woman to perform any duty\\nproperly, and I must again repeat, that sensibility is not reason.\\n\\nThe comparison with the rich still occurs to me; for, when men\\nneglect the duties of humanity, women will do the same; a common\\nstream hurries them both along with thoughtless celerity.  Riches\\nand honours prevent a man from enlarging his understanding, and\\nenervate all his powers, by reversing the order of nature, which\\nhas ever made true pleasure the reward of labour.\\nPleasure--enervating pleasure is, likewise, within woman\\'s reach\\nwithout earning it.  But, till hereditary possessions are spread\\nabroad, how can we expect men to be proud of virtue?  And, till\\nthey are, women will govern them by the most direct means,\\nneglecting their dull domestic duties, to catch the pleasure that\\nis on the wing of time.\\n\\n\"The power of women,\" says some author, \"is her sensibility;\" and\\nmen not aware of the consequence, do all they can to make this\\npower swallow up every other.  Those who constantly employ their\\nsensibility will have most: for example; poets, painters, and\\ncomposers.  Yet, when the sensibility is thus increased at the\\nexpense of reason, and even the imagination, why do philosophical\\nmen complain of their fickleness?  The sexual attention of man\\nparticularly acts on female sensibility, and this sympathy has been\\nexercised from their youth up.  A husband cannot long pay those\\nattentions with the passion necessary to excite lively emotions,\\nand the heart, accustomed to lively emotions, turns to a new lover,\\nor pines in secret, the prey of virtue or prudence.  I mean when\\nthe heart has really been rendered susceptible, and the taste\\nformed; for I am apt to conclude, from what I have seen in\\nfashionable life, that vanity is oftener fostered than sensibility\\nby the mode of education, and the intercourse between the sexes,\\nwhich I have reprobated; and that coquetry more frequently proceeds\\nfrom vanity than from that inconstancy, which overstrained\\nsensibility naturally produces.\\n\\nAnother argument that has had a great weight with me, must, I\\nthink, have some force with every considerate benevolent heart.\\nGirls, who have been thus weakly educated, are often cruelly left\\nby their parents without any provision; and, of course, are\\ndependent on, not only the reason, but the bounty of their\\nbrothers.  These brothers are, to view the fairest side of the\\nquestion, good sort of men, and give as a favour, what children of\\nthe same parents had an equal right to.  In this equivocal\\nhumiliating situation, a docile female may remain some time, with a\\ntolerable degree of comfort.  But, when the brother marries, a\\nprobable circumstance, from being considered as the mistress of the\\nfamily, she is viewed with averted looks as an intruder, an\\nunnecessary burden on the benevolence of the master of the house,\\nand his new partner.\\n\\nWho can recount the misery, which many unfortunate beings, whose\\nminds and bodies are equally weak, suffer in such\\nsituations--unable to work and ashamed to beg?  The wife, a\\ncold-hearted, narrow-minded woman, and this is not an unfair\\nsupposition; for the present mode of education does not tend to\\nenlarge the heart any more than the understanding, is jealous of\\nthe little kindness which her husband shows to his relations; and\\nher sensibility not rising to humanity, she is displeased at seeing\\nthe property of HER children lavished on an helpless sister.\\n\\nThese are matters of fact, which have come under my eye again and\\nagain.  The consequence is obvious, the wife has recourse to\\ncunning to undermine the habitual affection, which she is afraid\\nopenly to oppose; and neither tears nor caresses are spared till\\nthe spy is worked out of her home, and thrown on the world,\\nunprepared for its difficulties; or sent, as a great effort of\\ngenerosity, or from some regard to propriety, with a small stipend,\\nand an uncultivated mind into joyless solitude.\\n\\nThese two women may be much upon a par, with respect to reason and\\nhumanity; and changing situations, might have acted just the same\\nselfish part; but had they been differently educated, the case\\nwould also have been very different.  The wife would not have had\\nthat sensibility, of which self is the centre, and reason might\\nhave taught her not to expect, and not even to be flattered by the\\naffection of her husband, if it led him to violate prior duties.\\nShe would wish not to love him, merely because he loved her, but on\\naccount of his virtues; and the sister might have been able to\\nstruggle for herself, instead of eating the bitter bread of\\ndependence.\\n\\nI am, indeed, persuaded that the heart, as well as the\\nunderstanding, is opened by cultivation; and by, which may not\\nappear so clear, strengthening the organs; I am not now talking of\\nmomentary flashes of sensibility, but of affections.  And, perhaps,\\nin the education of both sexes, the most difficult task is so to\\nadjust instruction as not to narrow the understanding, whilst the\\nheart is warmed by the generous juices of spring, just raised by\\nthe electric fermentation of the season; nor to dry up the feelings\\nby employing the mind in investigations remote from life.\\n\\nWith respect to women, when they receive a careful education, they\\nare either made fine ladies, brimful of sensibility, and teeming\\nwith capricious fancies; or mere notable women.  The latter are\\noften friendly, honest creatures, and have a shrewd kind of good\\nsense joined with worldly prudence, that often render them more\\nuseful members of society than the fine sentimental lady, though\\nthey possess neither greatness of mind nor taste.  The intellectual\\nworld is shut against them; take them out of their family or\\nneighbourhood, and they stand still; the mind finding no\\nemployment, for literature affords a fund of amusement, which they\\nhave never sought to relish, but frequently to despise.  The\\nsentiments and taste of more cultivated minds appear ridiculous,\\neven in those whom chance and family connexions have led them to\\nlove; but in mere acquaintance they think it all affectation.\\n\\nA man of sense can only love such a woman on account of her sex,\\nand respect her, because she is a trusty servant.  He lets her, to\\npreserve his own peace, scold the servants, and go to church in\\nclothes made of the very best materials.  A man of her own size of\\nunderstanding would, probably, not agree so well with her; for he\\nmight wish to encroach on her prerogative, and manage some domestic\\nconcerns himself.  Yet women, whose minds are not enlarged by\\ncultivation, or the natural selfishness of sensibility expanded by\\nreflection, are very unfit to manage a family; for by an undue\\nstretch of power, they are always tyrannizing to support a\\nsuperiority that only rests on the arbitrary distinction of\\nfortune.  The evil is sometimes more serious, and domestics are\\ndeprived of innocent indulgences, and made to work beyond their\\nstrength, in order to enable the notable woman to keep a better\\ntable, and outshine her neighbours in finery and parade.  If she\\nattend to her children, it is, in general, to dress them in a\\ncostly manner--and, whether, this attention arises from vanity or\\nfondness, it is equally pernicious.\\n\\nBesides, how many women of this description pass their days, or, at\\nleast their evenings, discontentedly.  Their husbands acknowledge\\nthat they are good managers, and chaste wives; but leave home to\\nseek for more agreeable, may I be allowed to use a significant\\nFrench word, piquant society; and the patient drudge, who fulfils\\nher task, like a blind horse in a mill, is defrauded of her just\\nreward; for the wages due to her are the caresses of her husband;\\nand women who have so few resources in themselves, do not very\\npatiently bear this privation of a natural right.\\n\\nA fine lady, on the contrary, has been taught to look down with\\ncontempt on the vulgar employments of life; though she has only\\nbeen incited to acquire accomplishments that rise a degree above\\nsense; for even corporeal accomplishments cannot be acquired with\\nany degree of precision, unless the understanding has been\\nstrengthened by exercise.  Without a foundation of principles taste\\nis superficial; and grace must arise from something deeper than\\nimitation.  The imagination, however, is heated, and the feelings\\nrendered fastidious, if not sophisticated; or, a counterpoise of\\njudgment is not acquired, when the heart still remains artless,\\nthough it becomes too tender.\\n\\nThese women are often amiable; and their hearts are really more\\nsensible to general benevolence, more alive to the sentiments that\\ncivilize life, than the square elbowed family drudge; but, wanting\\na due proportion of reflection and self-government, they only\\ninspire love; and are the mistresses of their husbands, whilst they\\nhave any hold on their affections; and the platonic friends of his\\nmale acquaintance.  These are the fair defects in nature; the women\\nwho appear to be created not to enjoy the fellowship of man, but to\\nsave him from sinking into absolute brutality, by rubbing off the\\nrough angles of his character; and by playful dalliance to give\\nsome dignity to the appetite that draws him to them.  Gracious\\nCreator of the whole human race! hast thou created such a being as\\nwoman, who can trace thy wisdom in thy works, and feel that thou\\nalone art by thy nature, exalted above her--for no better purpose?\\nCan she believe that she was only made to submit to man her equal;\\na being, who, like her, was sent into the world to acquire virtue?\\nCan she consent to be occupied merely to please him; merely to\\nadorn the earth, when her soul is capable of rising to thee?  And\\ncan she rest supinely dependent on man for reason, when she ought\\nto mount with him the arduous steeps of knowledge?\\n\\nYet, if love be the supreme good, let women be only educated to\\ninspire it, and let every charm be polished to intoxicate the\\nsenses; but, if they are moral beings, let them have a chance to\\nbecome intelligent; and let love to man be only a part of that\\nglowing flame of universal love, which, after encircling humanity,\\nmounts in grateful incense to God.\\n\\nTo fulfil domestic duties much resolution is necessary, and a\\nserious kind of perseverance that requires a more firm support than\\nemotions, however lively and true to nature.  To give an example of\\norder, the soul of virtue, some austerity of behaviour must be\\nadopted, scarcely to be expected from a being who, from its\\ninfancy, has been made the weathercock of its own sensations.\\nWhoever rationally means to be useful, must have a plan of conduct;\\nand, in the discharge of the simplest duty, we are often obliged to\\nact contrary to the present impulse of tenderness or compassion.\\nSeverity is frequently the most certain, as well as the most\\nsublime proof of affection; and the want of this power over the\\nfeelings, and of that lofty, dignified affection, which makes a\\nperson prefer the future good of the beloved object to a present\\ngratification, is the reason why so many fond mothers spoil their\\nchildren, and has made it questionable, whether negligence or\\nindulgence is most hurtful:  but I am inclined to think, that the\\nlatter has done most harm.\\n\\nMankind seem to agree, that children should be left under the\\nmanagement of women during their childhood.  Now, from all the\\nobservation that I have been able to make, women of sensibility are\\nthe most unfit for this task, because they will infallibly, carried\\naway by their feelings, spoil a child\\'s temper.  The management of\\nthe temper, the first and most important branch of education,\\nrequires the sober steady eye of reason; a plan of conduct equally\\ndistant from tyranny and indulgence; yet these are the extremes\\nthat people of sensibility alternately fall into; always shooting\\nbeyond the mark.  I have followed this train of reasoning much\\nfurther, till I have concluded, that a person of genius is the most\\nimproper person to be employed in education, public or private.\\nMinds of this rare species see things too much in masses, and\\nseldom, if ever, have a good temper.  That habitual cheerfulness,\\ntermed good humour, is, perhaps, as seldom united with great mental\\npowers, as with strong feelings.  And those people who follow, with\\ninterest and admiration, the flights of genius; or, with cooler\\napprobation suck in the instruction, which has been elaborately\\nprepared for them by the profound thinker, ought not to be\\ndisgusted, if they find the former choleric, and the latter morose;\\nbecause liveliness of fancy, and a tenacious comprehension of mind,\\nare scarcely compatible with that pliant urbanity which leads a\\nman, at least to bend to the opinions and prejudices of others,\\ninstead of roughly confronting them.\\n\\nBut, treating of education or manners, minds of a superior class\\nare not to be considered, they may be left to chance; it is the\\nmultitude, with moderate abilities, who call for instruction, and\\ncatch the colour of the atmosphere they breathe.  This respectable\\nconcourse, I contend, men and women, should not have their\\nsensations heightened in the hot-bed of luxurious indolence, at the\\nexpence of their understanding; for, unless there be a ballast of\\nunderstanding, they will never become either virtuous or free:  an\\naristocracy, founded on property, or sterling talents, will ever\\nsweep before it, the alternately timid and ferocious slaves of\\nfeeling.\\n\\nNumberless are the arguments, to take another view of the subject,\\nbrought forward with a show of reason; because supposed to be\\ndeduced from nature, that men have used morally and physically to\\ndegrade the sex.  I must notice a few.\\n\\nThe female understanding has often been spoken of with contempt, as\\narriving sooner at maturity than the male.  I shall not answer this\\nargument by alluding to the early proofs of reason, as well as\\ngenius, in Cowley, Milton, and Pope, (Many other names might be\\nadded.) but only appeal to experience to decide whether young men,\\nwho are early introduced into company (and examples now abound) do\\nnot acquire the same precocity.  So notorious is this fact, that\\nthe bare mentioning of it must bring before people, who at all mix\\nin the world, the idea of a number of swaggering apes of men whose\\nunderstandings are narrowed by being brought into the society of\\nmen when they ought to have been spinning a top or twirling a hoop.\\n\\nIt has also been asserted, by some naturalists, that men do not\\nattain their full growth and strength till thirty; but that women\\narrive at maturity by twenty.  I apprehend that they reason on\\nfalse ground, led astray by the male prejudice, which deems beauty\\nthe perfection of woman--mere beauty of features and complexion,\\nthe vulgar acceptation of the world, whilst male beauty is allowed\\nto have some connexion with the mind.  Strength of body, and that\\ncharacter of countenance, which the French term a physionomie,\\nwomen do not acquire before thirty, any more than men.  The little\\nartless tricks of children, it is true, are particularly pleasing\\nand attractive; yet, when the pretty freshness of youth is worn\\noff, these artless graces become studied airs, and disgust every\\nperson of taste.  In the countenance of girls we only look for\\nvivacity and bashful modesty; but, the springtide of life over, we\\nlook for soberer sense in the face, and for traces of passion,\\ninstead of the dimples of animal spirits; expecting to see\\nindividuality of character, the only fastener of the affections.\\nWe then wish to converse, not to fondle; to give scope to our\\nimaginations, as well as to the sensations of our hearts.\\n\\nAt twenty the beauty of both sexes is equal; but the libertinism of\\nman leads him to make the distinction, and superannuated coquettes\\nare commonly of the same opinion; for when they can no longer\\ninspire love, they pay for the vigour and vivacity of youth.  The\\nFrench who admit more of mind into their notions of beauty, give\\nthe preference to women of thirty.  I mean to say, that they allow\\nwomen to be in their most perfect state, when vivacity gives place\\nto reason, and to that majestic seriousness of character, which\\nmarks maturity; or, the resting point.  In youth, till twenty the\\nbody shoots out; till thirty the solids are attaining a degree of\\ndensity; and the flexible muscles, growing daily more rigid, give\\ncharacter to the countenance; that is, they trace the operations of\\nthe mind with the iron pen of fate, and tell us not only what\\npowers are within, but how they have been employed.\\n\\nIt is proper to observe, that animals who arrive slowly at\\nmaturity, are the longest lived, and of the noblest species.  Men\\ncannot, however, claim any natural superiority from the grandeur of\\nlongevity; for in this respect nature has not distinguished the\\nmale.\\n\\nPolygamy is another physical degradation; and a plausible argument\\nfor a custom, that blasts every domestic virtue, is drawn from the\\nwell-attested fact, that in the countries where it is established,\\nmore females are born than males.  This appears to be an indication\\nof nature, and to nature apparently reasonable speculations must\\nyield.  A further conclusion obviously presents itself; if polygamy\\nbe necessary, woman must be inferior to man, and made for him.\\n\\nWith respect to the formation of the foetus in the womb, we are\\nvery ignorant; but it appears to me probable, that an accidental\\nphysical cause may account for this phenomenon, and prove it not to\\nbe a law of nature.  I have met with some pertinent observations on\\nthe subject in Forster\\'s Account of the Isles of the South Sea,\\nthat will explain my meaning.  After observing that of the two\\nsexes amongst animals, the most vigorous and hottest constitution\\nalways prevails, and produces its kind; he adds,--\"If this be\\napplied to the inhabitants of Africa, it is evident that the men\\nthere, accustomed to polygamy, are enervated by the use of so many\\nwomen, and therefore less vigorous; the women on the contrary, are\\nof a hotter constitution, not only on account of their more\\nirritable nerves, more sensitive organization, and more lively\\nfancy; but likewise because they are deprived in their matrimony of\\nthat share of physical love which in a monogamous condition, would\\nall be theirs; and thus for the above reasons, the generality of\\nchildren are born females.\"\\n\\n\"In the greater part of Europe it has been proved by the most\\naccurate lists of mortality, that the proportion of men to women is\\nnearly equal, or, if any difference takes place, the males born are\\nmore numerous, in the proportion of 105 to 100.\"\\n\\nThe necessity of polygamy, therefore, does not appear; yet when a\\nman seduces a woman, it should I think, be termed a LEFT-HANDED\\nmarriage, and the man should be LEGALLY obliged to maintain the\\nwoman and her children, unless adultery, a natural divorcement,\\nabrogated the law.  And this law should remain in force as long as\\nthe weakness of women caused the word seduction to be used as an\\nexcuse for their frailty and want of principle; nay, while they\\ndepend on man for a subsistence, instead of earning it by the\\nexercise of their own hands or heads.  But these women should not\\nin the full meaning of the relationship, be termed wives, or the\\nvery purpose of marriage would be subverted, and all those\\nendearing charities that flow from personal fidelity, and give a\\nsanctity to the tie, when neither love nor friendship unites the\\nhearts, would melt into selfishness.  The woman who is faithful to\\nthe father of her children demands respect, and should not be\\ntreated like a prostitute; though I readily grant, that if it be\\nnecessary for a man and woman to live together in order to bring up\\ntheir offspring, nature never intended that a man should have more\\nthan one wife.\\n\\nStill, highly as I respect marriage, as the foundation of almost\\nevery social virtue, I cannot avoid feeling the most lively\\ncompassion for those unfortunate females who are broken off from\\nsociety, and by one error torn from all those affections and\\nrelationships that improve the heart and mind.  It does not\\nfrequently even deserve the name of error; for many innocent girls\\nbecome the dupes of a sincere affectionate heart, and still more\\nare, as it may emphatically be termed, RUINED before they know the\\ndifference between virtue and vice:  and thus prepared by their\\neducation for infamy, they become infamous.  Asylums and Magdalens\\nare not the proper remedies for these abuses.  It is justice, not\\ncharity, that is wanting in the world!\\n\\nA woman who has lost her honour, imagines that she cannot fall\\nlower, and as for recovering her former station, it is impossible;\\nno exertion can wash this stain away.  Losing thus every spur, and\\nhaving no other means of support, prostitution becomes her only\\nrefuge, and the character is quickly depraved by circumstances over\\nwhich the poor wretch has little power, unless she possesses an\\nuncommon portion of sense and loftiness of spirit.  Necessity never\\nmakes prostitution the business of men\\'s lives; though numberless\\nare the women who are thus rendered systematically vicious.  This,\\nhowever, arises, in a great degree, from the state of idleness in\\nwhich women are educated, who are always taught to look up to man\\nfor a maintenance, and to consider their persons as the proper\\nreturn for his exertions to support them.  Meretricious airs, and\\nthe whole science of wantonness, has then a more powerful stimulus\\nthan either appetite or vanity; and this remark gives force to the\\nprevailing opinion, that with chastity all is lost that is\\nrespectable in woman.  Her character depends on the observance of\\none virtue, though the only passion fostered in her heart--is love.\\nNay the honour of a woman is not made even to depend on her will.\\n\\nWhen Richardson makes Clarissa tell Lovelace that he had robbed her\\nof her honour, he must have had strange notions of honour and\\nvirtue.  For, miserable beyond all names of misery is the condition\\nof a being, who could be degraded without its own consent!  This\\nexcess of strictness I have heard vindicated as a salutary error.\\nI shall answer in the words of Leibnitz--\"Errors are often useful;\\nbut it is commonly to remedy other errors.\"\\n\\nMost of the evils of life arise from a desire of present enjoyment\\nthat outruns itself.  The obedience required of women in the\\nmarriage state, comes under this description; the mind, naturally\\nweakened by depending on authority, never exerts its own powers,\\nand the obedient wife is thus rendered a weak indolent mother.  Or,\\nsupposing that this is not always the consequence, a future state\\nof existence is scarcely taken into the reckoning when only\\nnegative virtues are cultivated.  For in treating of morals,\\nparticularly when women are alluded to, writers have too often\\nconsidered virtue in a very limited sense, and made the foundation\\nof it SOLELY worldly utility; nay, a still more fragile base has\\nbeen given to this stupendous fabric, and the wayward fluctuating\\nfeelings of men have been made the standard of virtue.  Yes, virtue\\nas well as religion, has been subjected to the decisions of taste.\\n\\nIt would almost provoke a smile of contempt, if the vain\\nabsurdities of man did not strike us on all sides, to observe, how\\neager men are to degrade the sex from whom they pretend to receive\\nthe chief pleasure of life; and I have frequently, with full\\nconviction, retorted Pope\\'s sarcasm on them; or, to speak\\nexplicitly, it has appeared to me applicable to the whole human\\nrace.  A love of pleasure or sway seems to divide mankind, and the\\nhusband who lords it in his little harem, thinks only of his\\npleasure or his convenience.  To such lengths, indeed, does an\\nintemperate love of pleasure carry some prudent men, or worn out\\nlibertines, who marry to have a safe companion, that they seduce\\ntheir own wives.  Hymen banishes modesty, and chaste love takes its\\nflight.\\n\\nLove, considered as an animal appetite, cannot long feed on itself\\nwithout expiring.  And this extinction, in its own flame, may be\\ntermed the violent death of love.  But the wife who has thus been\\nrendered licentious, will probably endeavour to fill the void left\\nby the loss of her husband\\'s attentions; for she cannot contentedly\\nbecome merely an upper servant after having been treated like a\\ngoddess.  She is still handsome, and, instead of transferring her\\nfondness to her children, she only dreams of enjoying the sunshine\\nof life.  Besides, there are many husbands so devoid of sense and\\nparental affection, that during the first effervescence of\\nvoluptuous fondness, they refuse to let their wives suckle their\\nchildren.  They are only to dress and live to please them:  and\\nlove, even innocent love, soon sinks into lasciviousness when the\\nexercise of a duty is sacrificed to its indulgence.\\n\\nPersonal attachment is a very happy foundation for friendship; yet,\\nwhen even two virtuous young people marry, it would, perhaps, be\\nhappy if some circumstance checked their passion; if the\\nrecollection of some prior attachment, or disappointed affection,\\nmade it on one side, at least, rather a match founded on esteem.\\nIn that case they would look beyond the present moment, and try to\\nrender the whole of life respectable, by forming a plan to regulate\\na friendship which only death ought to dissolve.\\n\\nFriendship is a serious affection; the most sublime of all\\naffections, because it is founded on principle, and cemented by\\ntime.  The very reverse may be said of love.  In a great degree,\\nlove and friendship cannot subsist in the same bosom; even when\\ninspired by different objects they weaken or destroy each other,\\nand for the same object can only be felt in succession.  The vain\\nfears and fond jealousies, the winds which fan the flame of love,\\nwhen judiciously or artfully tempered, are both incompatible with\\nthe tender confidence and sincere respect of friendship.\\n\\nLove, such as the glowing pen of genius has traced, exists not on\\nearth, or only resides in those exalted, fervid imaginations that\\nhave sketched such dangerous pictures.  Dangerous, because they not\\nonly afford a plausible excuse to the voluptuary, who disguises\\nsheer sensuality under a sentimental veil; but as they spread\\naffectation, and take from the dignity of virtue.  Virtue, as the\\nvery word imports, should have an appearance of seriousness, if not\\nausterity; and to endeavour to trick her out in the garb of\\npleasure, because the epithet has been used as another name for\\nbeauty, is to exalt her on a quicksand; a most insidious attempt to\\nhasten her fall by apparent respect.  Virtue, and pleasure are not,\\nin fact, so nearly allied in this life as some eloquent writers\\nhave laboured to prove.  Pleasure prepares the fading wreath, and\\nmixes the intoxicating cup; but the fruit which virtue gives, is\\nthe recompence of toil:  and, gradually seen as it ripens, only\\naffords calm satisfaction; nay, appearing to be the result of the\\nnatural tendency of things, it is scarcely observed.  Bread, the\\ncommon food of life, seldom thought of as a blessing, supports the\\nconstitution, and preserves health; still feasts delight the heart\\nof man, though disease and even death lurk in the cup or dainty\\nthat elevates the spirits or tickles the palate.  The lively heated\\nimagination in the same style, draws the picture of love, as it\\ndraws every other picture, with those glowing colours, which the\\ndaring hand will steal from the rainbow that is directed by a mind,\\ncondemned, in a world like this, to prove its noble origin, by\\npanting after unattainable perfection; ever pursuing what it\\nacknowledges to be a fleeting dream.  An imagination of this\\nvigorous cast can give existence to insubstantial forms, and\\nstability to the shadowy reveries which the mind naturally falls\\ninto when realities are found vapid.  It can then depict love with\\ncelestial charms, and dote on the grand ideal object; it can\\nimagine a degree of mutual affection that shall refine the soul,\\nand not expire when it has served as a \"scale to heavenly;\" and,\\nlike devotion, make it absorb every meaner affection and desire.\\nIn each other\\'s arms, as in a temple, with its summit lost in the\\nclouds, the world is to be shut out, and every thought and wish,\\nthat do not nurture pure affection and permanent virtue.  Permanent\\nvirtue! alas! Rousseau, respectable visionary! thy paradise would\\nsoon be violated by the entrance of some unexpected guest.  Like\\nMilton\\'s, it would only contain angels, or men sunk below the\\ndignity of rational creatures.  Happiness is not material, it\\ncannot be seen or felt!  Yet the eager pursuit of the good which\\nevery one shapes to his own fancy, proclaims man the lord of this\\nlower world, and to be an intelligential creature, who is not to\\nreceive, but acquire happiness.  They, therefore, who complain of\\nthe delusions of passion, do not recollect that they are exclaiming\\nagainst a strong proof of the immortality of the soul.\\n\\nBut, leaving superior minds to correct themselves, and pay dearly\\nfor their experience, it is necessary to observe, that it is not\\nagainst strong, persevering passions; but romantic, wavering\\nfeelings, that I wish to guard the female heart by exercising the\\nunderstanding; for these paradisiacal reveries are oftener the\\neffect of idleness than of a lively fancy.\\n\\nWomen have seldom sufficient serious employment to silence their\\nfeelings; a round of little cares, or vain pursuits, frittering\\naway all strength of mind and organs, they become naturally only\\nobjects of sense.  In short, the whole tenor of female education\\n(the education of society) tends to render the best disposed,\\nromantic and inconstant; and the remainder vain and mean.  In the\\npresent state of society, this evil can scarcely be remedied, I am\\nafraid, in the slightest degree; should a more laudable ambition\\never gain ground, they may be brought nearer to nature and reason,\\nand become more virtuous and useful as they grow more respectable.\\n\\nBut I will venture to assert, that their reason will never acquire\\nsufficient strength to enable it to regulate their conduct, whilst\\nthe making an appearance in the world is the first wish of the\\nmajority of mankind.  To this weak wish the natural affections and\\nthe most useful virtues are sacrificed.  Girls marry merely to\\nBETTER THEMSELVES, to borrow a significant vulgar phrase, and have\\nsuch perfect power over their hearts as not to permit themselves to\\nFALL IN LOVE till a man with a superior fortune offers.  On this\\nsubject I mean to enlarge in a future chapter; it is only necessary\\nto drop a hint at present, because women are so often degraded by\\nsuffering the selfish prudence of age to chill the ardour of youth.\\n\\n>From the same source flows an opinion that young girls ought to\\ndedicate great part of their time to needle work; yet, this\\nemployment contracts their faculties more than any other that could\\nhave been chosen for them, by confining their thoughts to their\\npersons.  Men order their clothes to be made, and have done with\\nthe subject; women make their own clothes, necessary or ornamental,\\nand are continually talking about them; and their thoughts follow\\ntheir hands.  It is not indeed the making of necessaries that\\nweakens the mind; but the frippery of dress.  For when a woman in\\nthe lower rank of life makes her husband\\'s and children\\'s clothes,\\nshe does her duty, this is part of her business; but when women\\nwork only to dress better than they could otherwise afford, it is\\nworse than sheer loss of time.  To render the poor virtuous, they\\nmust be employed, and women in the middle rank of life did they not\\nape the fashions of the nobility, without catching their ease,\\nmight employ them, whilst they themselves managed their families,\\ninstructed their children, and exercised their own minds.\\nGardening, experimental philosophy, and literature, would afford\\nthem subjects to think of, and matter for conversation, that in\\nsome degree would exercise their understandings.  The conversation\\nof French women, who are not so rigidly nailed to their chairs, to\\ntwist lappets, and knot ribbands, is frequently superficial; but, I\\ncontend, that it is not half so insipid as that of those English\\nwomen, whose time is spent in making caps, bonnets, and the whole\\nmischief of trimmings, not to mention shopping, bargain-hunting,\\netc. etc.:  and it is the decent, prudent women, who are most\\ndegraded by these practices; for their motive is simply vanity.\\nThe wanton, who exercises her taste to render her person alluring,\\nhas something more in view.\\n\\nThese observations all branch out of a general one, which I have\\nbefore made, and which cannot be too often insisted upon, for,\\nspeaking of men, women, or professions, it will be found, that the\\nemployment of the thoughts shapes the character both generally and\\nindividually.  The thoughts of women ever hover around their\\npersons, and is it surprising that their persons are reckoned most\\nvaluable?  Yet some degree of liberty of mind is necessary even to\\nform the person; and this may be one reason why some gentle wives\\nhave so few attractions beside that of sex.  Add to this, sedentary\\nemployments render the majority of women sickly, and false notions\\nof female excellence make them proud of this delicacy, though it be\\nanother fetter, that by calling the attention continually to the\\nbody, cramps the activity of the mind.\\n\\nWomen of quality seldom do any of the manual part of their dress,\\nconsequently only their taste is exercised, and they acquire, by\\nthinking less of the finery, when the business of their toilet is\\nover, that ease, which seldom appears in the deportment of women,\\nwho dress merely for the sake of dressing.  In fact, the\\nobservation with respect to the middle rank, the one in which\\ntalents thrive best, extends not to women; for those of the\\nsuperior class, by catching, at least a smattering of literature,\\nand conversing more with men, on general topics, acquire more\\nknowledge than the women who ape their fashions and faults without\\nsharing their advantages.  With respect to virtue, to use the word\\nin a comprehensive sense, I have seen most in low life.  Many poor\\nwomen maintain their children by the sweat of their brow, and keep\\ntogether families that the vices of the fathers would have\\nscattered abroad; but gentlewomen are too indolent to be actively\\nvirtuous, and are softened rather than refined by civilization.\\nIndeed the good sense which I have met with among the poor women\\nwho have had few advantages of education, and yet have acted\\nheroically, strongly confirmed me in the opinion, that trifling\\nemployments have rendered women a trifler.  Men, taking her (\\'I\\ntake her body,\\' says Ranger.) body, the mind is left to rust; so\\nthat while physical love enervates man, as being his favourite\\nrecreation, he will endeavour to enslave woman:  and who can tell\\nhow many generations may be necessary to give vigour to the virtue\\nand talents of the freed posterity of abject slaves?  (\\'Supposing\\nthat women are voluntary slaves--slavery of any kind is\\nunfavourable to human happiness and improvement.\\'--\\'Knox\\'s\\nEssays\\'.)\\n\\nIn tracing the causes that in my opinion, have degraded woman, I\\nhave confined my observations to such as universally act upon the\\nmorals and manners of the whole sex, and to me it appears clear,\\nthat they all spring from want of understanding.  Whether this\\narises from a physical or accidental weakness of faculties, time\\nalone can determine; for I shall not lay any great stress upon the\\nexample of a few women (Sappho, Eloisa, Mrs. Macaulay, the Empress\\nof Russia, Madame d\\'Eon, etc.  These, and many more, may be\\nreckoned exceptions; and, are not all heroes, as well as heroines,\\nexceptions to general rules?  I wish to see women neither heroines\\nnor brutes; but reasonable creatures.) who, from having received a\\nmasculine education, have acquired courage and resolution; I only\\ncontend that the men who have been placed in similar situations\\nhave acquired a similar character, I speak of bodies of men, and\\nthat men of genius and talents have started out of a class, in\\nwhich women have never yet been placed.\\n\\n',\n",

Yet truth is not with\\nimpunity to be sported with, for the practised dissembler, at last,\\nbecomes the dupe of his own arts, loses that sagacity which has\\nbeen justly termed common sense; namely, a quick perception of\\ncommon truths:  which are constantly received as such by the\\nunsophisticated mind, though it might not have had sufficient\\nenergy to discover them itself, when obscured by local prejudices.\\nThe greater number of people take their opinions on trust, to avoid\\nthe trouble of exercising their own minds, and these indolent\\nbeings naturally adhere to the letter, rather than the spirit of a\\nlaw, divine or human.  \"Women,\" says some author, I cannot\\nrecollect who, \"mind not what only heaven sees.\"  Why, indeed\\nshould they? it is the eye of man that they have been taught to\\ndread--and if they can lull their Argus to sleep, they seldom think\\nof heaven or themselves, because their reputation is safe; and it\\nis reputation not chastity and all its fair train, that they are\\nemployed to keep free from spot, not as a virtue, but to preserve\\ntheir station in the world.\\n\\nTo prove the truth of this remark, I need only advert to the\\nintrigues of married women, particularly in high life, and in\\ncountries where women are suitably married, according to their\\nrespective ranks by their parents.  If an innocent girl become a\\nprey to love, she is degraded forever, though her mind was not\\npolluted by the arts which married women, under the convenient\\ncloak of marriage, practise; nor has she violated any duty--but the\\nduty of respecting herself.  The married woman, on the contrary,\\nbreaks a most sacred engagement, and becomes a cruel mother when\\nshe is a false and faithless wife.  If her husband has still an\\naffection for her, the arts which she must practise to deceive him,\\nwill render her the most contemptible of human beings; and at any\\nrate, the contrivances necessary to preserve appearances, will keep\\nher mind in that childish or vicious tumult which destroys all its\\nenergy.  Besides, in time, like those people who habitually take\\ncordials to raise their spirits, she will want an intrigue to give\\nlife to her thoughts, having lost all relish for pleasures that are\\nnot highly seasoned by hope or fear.\\n\\nSometimes married women act still more audaciously; I will mention\\nan instance.\\n\\nA woman of quality, notorious for her gallantries, though as she\\nstill lived with her husband, nobody chose to place her in the\\nclass where she ought to have been placed, made a point of treating\\nwith the most insulting contempt a poor timid creature, abashed by\\na sense of her former weakness, whom a neighbouring gentleman had\\nseduced and afterwards married.  This woman had actually confounded\\nvirtue with reputation; and, I do believe, valued herself on the\\npropriety of her behaviour before marriage, though when once\\nsettled, to the satisfaction of her family, she and her lord were\\nequally faithless--so that the half alive heir to an immense estate\\ncame from heaven knows where!\\n\\nTo view this subject in another light.\\n\\nI have known a number of women who, if they did not love their\\nhusbands, loved nobody else, giving themselves entirely up to\\nvanity and dissipation, neglecting every domestic duty; nay, even\\nsquandering away all the money which should have been saved for\\ntheir helpless younger children, yet have plumed themselves on\\ntheir unsullied reputation, as if the whole compass of their duty\\nas wives and mothers was only to preserve it.  Whilst other\\nindolent women, neglecting every personal duty, have thought that\\nthey deserved their husband\\'s affection, because they acted in this\\nrespect with propriety.\\n\\nWeak minds are always fond of resting in the ceremonials of duty,\\nbut morality offers much simpler motives; and it were to be wished\\nthat superficial moralists had said less respecting behaviour, and\\noutward observances, for unless virtue, of any kind, is built on\\nknowledge, it will only produce a kind of insipid decency.  Respect\\nfor the opinion of the world, has, however, been termed the\\nprincipal duty of woman in the most express words, for Rousseau\\ndeclares, \"that reputation is no less indispensable than chastity.\"\\n\"A man,\" adds he, \"secure in his own good conduct, depends only on\\nhimself, and may brave the public opinion; but a woman, in behaving\\nwell, performs but half her duty; as what is thought of her, is as\\nimportant to her as what she really is.  It follows hence, that the\\nsystem of a woman\\'s education should, in this respect, be directly\\ncontrary to that of ours.  Opinion is the grave of virtue among the\\nmen; but its throne among women.\"  It is strictly logical to infer,\\nthat the virtue that rests on opinion is merely worldly, and that\\nit is the virtue of a being to whom reason has been denied.  But,\\neven with respect to the opinion of the world, I am convinced, that\\nthis class of reasoners are mistaken.\\n\\nThis regard for reputation, independent of its being one of the\\nnatural rewards of virtue, however, took its rise from a cause that\\nI have already deplored as the grand source of female depravity,\\nthe impossibility of regaining respectability by a return to\\nvirtue, though men preserve theirs during the indulgence of vice.\\nIt was natural for women then to endeavour to preserve what once\\nlost--was lost for ever, till this care swallowing up every other\\ncare, reputation for chastity, became the one thing needful to the\\nsex.  But vain is the scrupulosity of ignorance, for neither\\nreligion nor virtue, when they reside in the heart, require such a\\npuerile attention to mere ceremonies, because the behaviour must,\\nupon the whole be proper, when the motive is pure.\\n\\nTo support my opinion I can produce very respectable authority; and\\nthe authority of a cool reasoner ought to have weight to enforce\\nconsideration, though not to establish a sentiment.  Speaking of\\nthe general laws of morality, Dr. Smith observes--\"That by some\\nvery extraordinary and unlucky circumstance, a good man may come to\\nbe suspected of a crime of which he was altogether incapable, and\\nupon that account be most unjustly exposed for the remaining part\\nof his life to the horror and aversion of mankind.  By an accident\\nof this kind he may be said to lose his all, notwithstanding his\\nintegrity and justice, in the same manner as a cautious man,\\nnotwithstanding his utmost circumspection, may be ruined by an\\nearthquake or an inundation.  Accidents of the first kind, however,\\nare perhaps still more rare, and still more contrary to the common\\ncourse of things than those of the second; and it still remains\\ntrue, that the practice of truth, justice and humanity, is a\\ncertain and almost infallible method of acquiring what those\\nvirtues chiefly aim at, the confidence and love of those we live\\nwith.  A person may be easily misrepresented with regard to a\\nparticular action; but it is scarcely possible that he should be so\\nwith regard to the general tenor of his conduct.  An innocent man\\nmay be believed to have done wrong:  this, however, will rarely\\nhappen.  On the contrary, the established opinion of the innocence\\nof his manners will often lead us to absolve him where he has\\nreally been in the fault, notwithstanding very strong\\npresumptions.\"\\n\\nI perfectly coincide in opinion with this writer, for I verily\\nbelieve, that few of either sex were ever despised for certain\\nvices without deserving to be despised.  I speak not of the calumny\\nof the moment, which hangs over a character, like one of the dense\\nfogs of November over this metropolis, till it gradually subsides\\nbefore the common light of day, I only contend, that the daily\\nconduct of the majority prevails to stamp their character with the\\nimpression of truth.  Quietly does the clear light, shining day\\nafter day, refute the ignorant surmise, or malicious tale, which\\nhas thrown dirt on a pure character.  A false light distorted, for\\na short time, its shadow--reputation; but it seldom fails to become\\njust when the cloud is dispersed that produced the mistake in\\nvision.\\n\\nMany people, undoubtedly in several respects, obtain a better\\nreputation than, strictly speaking, they deserve, for unremitting\\nindustry will mostly reach its goal in all races.  They who only\\nstrive for this paltry prize, like the Pharisees, who prayed at the\\ncorners of streets, to be seen of men, verily obtain the reward\\nthey seek; for the heart of man cannot be read by man!  Still the\\nfair fame that is naturally reflected by good actions, when the man\\nis only employed to direct his steps aright, regardless of the\\nlookers-on, is in general, not only more true but more sure.\\n\\nThere are, it is true, trials when the good man must appeal to God\\nfrom the injustice of man; and amidst the whining candour or\\nhissing of envy, erect a pavilion in his own mind to retire to,\\ntill the rumour be overpast; nay, the darts of undeserved censure\\nmay pierce an innocent tender bosom through with many sorrows; but\\nthese are all exceptions to general rules.  And it is according to\\nthese common laws that human behaviour ought to be regulated.  The\\neccentric orbit of the comet never influences astronomical\\ncalculations respecting the invariable order established in the\\nmotion of the principal bodies of the solar system.\\n\\nI will then venture to affirm, that after a man has arrived at\\nmaturity, the general outline of his character in the world is\\njust, allowing for the before mentioned exceptions to the rule.  I\\ndo not say, that a prudent, worldly-wise man, with only negative\\nvirtues and qualities, may not sometimes obtain a smoother\\nreputation than a wiser or a better man.  So far from it, that I am\\napt to conclude from experience, that where the virtue of two\\npeople is nearly equal, the most negative character will be liked\\nbest by the world at large, whilst the other may have more friends\\nin private life.  But the hills and dales, clouds and sunshine,\\nconspicuous in the virtues of great men, set off each other; and\\nthough they afford envious weakness a fairer mark to shoot at, the\\nreal character will still work its way to light, though bespattered\\nby weak affection, or ingenious malice.*\\n\\n(*Footnote.  I allude to various biographical writings, but\\nparticularly to Boswell\\'s Life of Johnson.)\\n\\nWith respect to that anxiety to preserve a reputation hardly\\nearned, which leads sagacious people to analyze it, I shall not\\nmake the obvious comment; but I am afraid that morality is very\\ninsidiously undermined, in the female world, by the attention being\\nturned to the show instead of the substance.  A simple thing is\\nthus made strangely complicated; nay, sometimes virtue and its\\nshadow are set at variance.  We should never, perhaps, have heard\\nof Lucretia, had she died to preserve her chastity instead of her\\nreputation.  If we really deserve our own good opinion, we shall\\ncommonly be respected in the world; but if we pant after higher\\nimprovement and higher attainments, it is not sufficient to view\\nourselves as we suppose that we are viewed by others, though this\\nhas been ingeniously argued as the foundation of our moral\\nsentiments.  (Smith.)  Because each bystander may have his own\\nprejudices, besides the prejudices of his age or country.  We\\nshould rather endeavour to view ourselves, as we suppose that Being\\nviews us, who seeth each thought ripen into action, and whose\\njudgment never swerves from the eternal rule of right.  Righteous\\nare all his judgments--just, as merciful!\\n\\nThe humble mind that seeketh to find favour in His sight, and\\ncalmly examines its conduct when only His presence is felt, will\\nseldom form a very erroneous opinion of its own virtues.  During\\nthe still hour of self-collection, the angry brow of offended\\njustice will be fearfully deprecated, or the tie which draws man to\\nthe Deity will be recognized in the pure sentiment of reverential\\nadoration, that swells the heart without exciting any tumultuous\\nemotions.  In these solemn moments man discovers the germ of those\\nvices, which like the Java tree shed a pestiferous vapour\\naround--death is in the shade! and he perceives them without\\nabhorrence, because he feels himself drawn by some cord of love to\\nall his fellow creatures, for whose follies he is anxious to find\\nevery extenuation in their nature--in himself.  If I, he may thus\\nargue, who exercise my own mind, and have been refined by\\ntribulation, find the serpent\\'s egg in some fold of my heart, and\\ncrush it with difficulty, shall not I pity those who are stamped\\nwith less vigour, or who have heedlessly nurtured the insidious\\nreptile till it poisoned the vital stream it sucked?  Can I,\\nconscious of my secret sins, throw off my fellow creatures, and\\ncalmly see them drop into the chasm of perdition, that yawns to\\nreceive them.  No! no!  The agonized heart will cry with\\nsuffocating impatience--I too am a man! and have vices, hid,\\nperhaps, from human eye, that bend me to the dust before God, and\\nloudly tell me when all is mute, that we are formed of the same\\nearth, and breathe the same element.  Humanity thus rises naturally\\nout of humility, and twists the cords of love that in various\\nconvolutions entangle the heart.\\n\\nThis sympathy extends still further, till a man well pleased\\nobserves force in arguments that do not carry conviction to his own\\nbosom, and he gladly places in the fairest light to himself, the\\nshows of reason that have led others astray, rejoiced to find some\\nreason in all the errors of man; though before convinced that he\\nwho rules the day makes his sun to shine on all.  Yet, shaking\\nhands thus, as it were, with corruption, one foot on earth, the\\nother with bold strides mounts to heaven, and claims kindred with\\nsuperiour natures.  Virtues, unobserved by men, drop their balmy\\nfragrance at this cool hour, and the thirsty land, refreshed by the\\npure streams of comfort that suddenly gush out, is crowned with\\nsmiling verdure; this is the living green on which that eye may\\nlook with complacency that is too pure to behold iniquity! But my\\nspirits flag; and I must silently indulge the reverie these\\nreflections lead to, unable to describe the sentiments that have\\ncalmed my soul, when watching the rising sun, a soft shower\\ndrizzling through the leaves of neighbouring trees, seemed to fall\\non my languid, yet tranquil spirits, to cool the heart that had\\nbeen heated by the passions which reason laboured to tame.\\n\\nThe leading principles which run through all my disquisitions,\\nwould render it unnecessary to enlarge on this subject, if a\\nconstant attention to keep the varnish of the character fresh, and\\nin good condition, were not often inculcated as the sum total of\\nfemale duty; if rules to regulate the behaviour, and to preserve\\nthe reputation, did not too frequently supersede moral obligations.\\nBut, with respect to reputation, the attention is confined to a\\nsingle virtue--chastity.  If the honour of a woman, as it is\\nabsurdly called, is safe, she may neglect every social duty; nay,\\nruin her family by gaming and extravagance; yet still present a\\nshameless front --for truly she is an honourable woman!\\n\\nMrs. Macaulay has justly observed, that \"there is but one fault\\nwhich a woman of honour may not commit with impunity.\"  She then\\njustly and humanely adds--This has given rise to the trite and\\nfoolish observation, that the first fault against chastity in woman\\nhas a radical power to deprave the character.  But no such frail\\nbeings come out of the hands of nature.  The human mind is built of\\nnobler materials than to be so easily corrupted; and with all their\\ndisadvantages of situation and education, women seldom become\\nentirely abandoned till they are thrown into a state of\\ndesperation, by the venomous rancour of their own sex.\"\\n\\nBut, in proportion as this regard for the reputation of chastity is\\nprized by women, it is despised by men:  and the two extremes are\\nequally destructive to morality.\\n\\nMen are certainly more under the influence of their appetites than\\nwomen; and their appetites are more depraved by unbridled\\nindulgence, and the fastidious contrivances of satiety.  Luxury has\\nintroduced a refinement in eating that destroys the constitution;\\nand, a degree of gluttony which is so beastly, that a perception of\\nseemliness of behaviour must be worn out before one being could eat\\nimmoderately in the presence of another, and afterwards complain of\\nthe oppression that his intemperance naturally produced.  Some\\nwomen, particularly French women, have also lost a sense of decency\\nin this respect; for they will talk very calmly of an indigestion.\\nIt were to be wished, that idleness was not allowed to generate, on\\nthe rank soil of wealth, those swarms of summer insects that feed\\non putrefaction; we should not then be disgusted by the sight of\\nsuch brutal excesses.\\n\\nThere is one rule relative to behaviour that, I think, ought to\\nregulate every other; and it is simply to cherish such an habitual\\nrespect for mankind, as may prevent us from disgusting a fellow\\ncreature for the sake of a present indulgence.  The shameful\\nindolence of many married women, and others a little advanced in\\nlife, frequently leads them to sin against delicacy.  For, though\\nconvinced that the person is the band of union between the sexes,\\nyet, how often do they from sheer indolence, or to enjoy some\\ntrifling indulgence, disgust?\\n\\nThe depravity of the appetite, which brings the sexes together, has\\nhad a still more fatal effect.  Nature must ever be the standard of\\ntaste, the guage of appetite--yet how grossly is nature insulted by\\nthe voluptuary.  Leaving the refinements of love out of the\\nquestion; nature, by making the gratification of an appetite, in\\nthis respect, as well as every other, a natural and imperious law\\nto preserve the species, exalts the appetite, and mixes a little\\nmind and affection with a sensual gust.  The feelings of a parent\\nmingling with an instinct merely animal, give it dignity; and the\\nman and woman often meeting on account of the child, a mutual\\ninterest and affection is excited by the exercise of a common\\nsympathy.  Women then having necessarily some duty to fulfil, more\\nnoble than to adorn their persons, would not contentedly be the\\nslaves of casual appetite, which is now the situation of a very\\nconsiderable number who are, literally speaking, standing dishes to\\nwhich every glutton may have access.\\n\\nI may be told, that great as this enormity is, it only affects a\\ndevoted part of the sex--devoted for the salvation of the rest.\\nBut, false as every assertion might easily be proved, that\\nrecommends the sanctioning a small evil to produce a greater good;\\nthe mischief does not stop here, for the moral character, and peace\\nof mind, of the chaster part of the sex, is undermined by the\\nconduct of the very women to whom they allow no refuge from guilt:\\nwhom they inexorably consign to the exercise of arts that lure\\ntheir husbands from them, debauch their sons and force them, let\\nnot modest women start, to assume, in some degree, the same\\ncharacter themselves.  For I will venture to assert, that all the\\ncauses of female weakness, as well as depravity, which I have\\nalready enlarged on, branch out of one grand cause--want of\\nchastity in men.\\n\\nThis intemperance, so prevalent, depraves the appetite to such a\\ndegree, that a wanton stimulus is necessary to rouse it; but the\\nparental design of nature is forgotten, and the mere person, and\\nthat, for a moment, alone engrosses the thoughts.  So voluptuous,\\nindeed, often grows the lustful prowler, that he refines on female\\nsoftness.\\n\\nTo satisfy this genius of men, women are made systematically\\nvoluptuous, and though they may not all carry their libertinism to\\nthe same height, yet this heartless intercourse with the sex, which\\nthey allow themselves, depraves both sexes, because the taste of\\nmen is vitiated; and women, of all classes, naturally square their\\nbehaviour to gratify the taste by which they obtain pleasure and\\npower.  Women becoming, consequently weaker, in mind and body, than\\nthey ought to be, were one of the grand ends of their being taken\\ninto the account, that of bearing and nursing children, have not\\nsufficient strength to discharge the first duty of a mother; and\\nsacrificing to lasciviousness the parental affection, that ennobles\\ninstinct, either destroy the embryo in the womb, or cast it off\\nwhen born.  Nature in every thing demands respect, and those who\\nviolate her laws seldom violate them with impunity.  The weak\\nenervated women who particularly catch the attention of libertines,\\nare unfit to be mothers, though they may conceive; so that the rich\\nsensualist, who has rioted among women, spreading depravity and\\nmisery, when he wishes to perpetuate his name, receives from his\\nwife only an half-formed being that inherits both its father\\'s and\\nmother\\'s weakness.\\n\\nContrasting the humanity of the present age with the barbarism of\\nantiquity, great stress has been laid on the savage custom of\\nexposing the children whom their parents could not maintain; whilst\\nthe man of sensibility, who thus, perhaps, complains, by his\\npromiscuous amours produces a most destructive barrenness and\\ncontagious flagitiousness of manners.  Surely nature never intended\\nthat women, by satisfying an appetite, should frustrate the very\\npurpose for which it was implanted?\\n\\nI have before observed, that men ought to maintain the women whom\\nthey have seduced; this would be one means of reforming female\\nmanners, and stopping an abuse that has an equally fatal effect on\\npopulation and morals.  Another, no less obvious, would be to turn\\nthe attention of woman to the real virtue of chastity; for to\\nlittle respect has that woman a claim, on the score of modesty,\\nthough her reputation may be white as the driven snow, who smiles\\non the libertine whilst she spurns the victims of his lawless\\nappetites and their own folly.\\n\\nBesides, she has a taint of the same folly, pure as she esteems\\nherself, when she studiously adorns her person only to be seen by\\nmen, to excite respectful sighs, and all the idle homage of what is\\ncalled innocent gallantry.  Did women really respect virtue for its\\nown sake, they would not seek for a compensation in vanity, for the\\nself-denial which they are obliged to practise to preserve their\\nreputation, nor would they associate with men who set reputation at\\ndefiance.\\n\\nThe two sexes mutually corrupt and improve each other.  This I\\nbelieve to be an indisputable truth, extending it to every virtue.\\nChastity, modesty, public spirit, and all the noble train of\\nvirtues, on which social virtue and happiness are built, should be\\nunderstood and cultivated by all mankind, or they will be\\ncultivated to little effect.  And, instead of furnishing the\\nvicious or idle with a pretext for violating some sacred duty, by\\nterming it a sexual one, it would be wiser to show, that nature has\\nnot made any difference, for that the unchaste man doubly defeats\\nthe purpose of nature by rendering women barren, and destroying his\\nown constitution, though he avoids the shame that pursues the crime\\nin the other sex.  These are the physical consequences, the moral\\nare still more alarming; for virtue is only a nominal distinction\\nwhen the duties of citizens, husbands, wives, fathers, mothers, and\\ndirectors of families, become merely the selfish ties of\\nconvenience.\\n\\nWhy then do philosophers look for public spirit?  Public spirit\\nmust be nurtured by private virtue, or it will resemble the\\nfactitious sentiment which makes women careful to preserve their\\nreputation, and men their honour.  A sentiment that often exists\\nunsupported by virtue, unsupported by that sublime morality which\\nmakes the habitual breach of one duty a breach of the whole moral\\nlaw.\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nBodily strength from being the distinction of heroes is now sunk\\ninto such unmerited contempt, that men as well as women, seem to\\nthink it unnecessary:  the latter, as it takes from their feminine\\ngraces, and from that lovely weakness, the source of their undue\\npower; and the former, because it appears inimical with the\\ncharacter of a gentleman.\\n\\nThat they have both by departing from one extreme run into another,\\nmay easily be proved; but it first may be proper to observe, that a\\nvulgar error has obtained a degree of credit, which has given force\\nto a false conclusion, in which an effect has been mistaken for a\\ncause.\\n\\nPeople of genius have, very frequently, impaired their\\nconstitutions by study, or careless inattention to their health,\\nand the violence of their passions bearing a proportion to the\\nvigour of their intellects, the sword\\'s destroying the scabbard has\\nbecome almost proverbial, and superficial observers have inferred\\nfrom thence, that men of genius have commonly weak, or to use a\\nmore fashionable phrase, delicate constitutions.  Yet the contrary,\\nI believe, will appear to be the fact; for, on diligent inquiry, I\\nfind that strength of mind has, in most cases, been accompanied by\\nsuperior strength of body, natural soundness of constitution, not\\nthat robust tone of nerves and vigour of muscles, which arise from\\nbodily labour, when the mind is quiescent, or only directs the\\nhands.\\n\\nDr. Priestley has remarked, in the preface to his biographical\\nchart, that the majority of great men have lived beyond forty-five.\\nAnd, considering the thoughtless manner in which they lavished\\ntheir strength, when investigating a favourite science, they have\\nwasted the lamp of life, forgetful of the midnight hour; or, when,\\nlost in poetic dreams, fancy has peopled the scene, and the soul\\nhas been disturbed, till it shook the constitution, by the passions\\nthat meditation had raised; whose objects, the baseless fabric of a\\nvision, faded before the exhausted eye, they must have had iron\\nframes.  Shakespeare never grasped the airy dagger with a nerveless\\nhand, nor did Milton tremble when he led Satan far from the\\nconfines of his dreary prison.  These were not the ravings of\\nimbecility, the sickly effusions of distempered brains; but the\\nexuberance of fancy, that \"in a fine phrenzy\" wandering, was not\\ncontinually reminded of its material shackles.\\n\\nI am aware, that this argument would carry me further than it may\\nbe supposed I wish to go; but I follow truth, and still adhering to\\nmy first position, I will allow that bodily strength seems to give\\nman a natural superiority over woman; and this is the only solid\\nbasis on which the superiority of the sex can be built.  But I\\nstill insist, that not only the virtue, but the KNOWLEDGE of the\\ntwo sexes should be the same in nature, if not in degree, and that\\nwomen, considered not only as moral, but rational creatures, ought\\nto endeavour to acquire human virtues (or perfections) by the SAME\\nmeans as men, instead of being educated like a fanciful kind of\\nHALF being, one of Rousseau\\'s wild chimeras.\\n\\nBut, if strength of body be, with some show of reason, the boast of\\nmen, why are women so infatuated as to be proud of a defect?\\nRousseau has furnished them with a plausible excuse, which could\\nonly have occurred to a man, whose imagination had been allowed to\\nrun wild, and refine on the impressions made by exquisite senses,\\nthat they might, forsooth have a pretext for yielding to a natural\\nappetite without violating a romantic species of modesty, which\\ngratifies the pride and libertinism of man.\\n\\nWomen deluded by these sentiments, sometimes boast of their\\nweakness, cunningly obtaining power by playing on the WEAKNESS of\\nmen; and they may well glory in their illicit sway, for, like\\nTurkish bashaws, they have more real power than their masters:  but\\nvirtue is sacrificed to temporary gratifications, and the\\nrespectability of life to the triumph of an hour.\\n\\nWomen, as well as despots, have now, perhaps, more power than they\\nwould have, if the world, divided and subdivided into kingdoms and\\nfamilies, was governed by laws deduced from the exercise of reason;\\nbut in obtaining it, to carry on the comparison, their character is\\ndegraded, and licentiousness spread through the whole aggregate of\\nsociety.  The many become pedestal to the few.  I, therefore will\\nventure to assert, that till women are more rationally educated,\\nthe progress of human virtue and improvement in knowledge must\\nreceive continual checks.  And if it be granted, that woman was not\\ncreated merely to gratify the appetite of man, nor to be the upper\\nservant, who provides his meals and takes care of his linen, it\\nmust follow, that the first care of those mothers or fathers, who\\nreally attend to the education of females, should be, if not to\\nstrengthen the body, at least, not to destroy the constitution by\\nmistaken notions of beauty and female excellence; nor should girls\\never be allowed to imbibe the pernicious notion that a defect can,\\nby any chemical process of reasoning become an excellence.  In this\\nrespect, I am happy to find, that the author of one of the most\\ninstructive books, that our country has produced for children,\\ncoincides with me in opinion; I shall quote his pertinent remarks\\nto give the force of his respectable authority to reason.*\\n\\n(*Footnote.  A respectable old man gives the following sensible\\naccount of the method he pursued when educating his daughter.  \"I\\nendeavoured to give both to her mind and body a degree of vigour,\\nwhich is seldom found in the female sex.  As soon as she was\\nsufficiently advanced in strength to be capable of the lighter\\nlabours of husbandry and gardening, I employed her as my constant\\ncompanion.  Selene, for that was her name, soon acquired a\\ndexterity in all these rustic employments which I considered with\\nequal pleasure and admiration.  If women are in general feeble both\\nin body and mind, it arises less from nature than from education.\\nWe encourage a vicious indolence and inactivity, which we falsely\\ncall delicacy; instead of hardening their minds by the severer\\nprinciples of reason and philosophy, we breed them to useless arts,\\nwhich terminate in vanity and sensuality.  In most of the countries\\nwhich I had visited, they are taught nothing of an higher nature\\nthan a few modulations of the voice, or useless postures of the\\nbody; their time is consumed in sloth or trifles, and trifles\\nbecome the only pursuits capable of interesting them.  We seem to\\nforget, that it is upon the qualities of the female sex, that our\\nown domestic comforts and the education of our children must\\ndepend.  And what are the comforts or the education which a race of\\nbeings corrupted from their infancy, and unacquainted with all the\\nduties of life, are fitted to bestow?  To touch a musical\\ninstrument with useless skill, to exhibit their natural or affected\\ngraces, to the eyes of indolent and debauched young men, who\\ndissipate their husbands\\' patrimony in riotous and unnecessary\\nexpenses:  these are the only arts cultivated by women in most of\\nthe polished nations I had seen.  And the consequences are\\nuniformly such as may be expected to proceed from such polluted\\nsources, private misery, and public servitude.\\n\\n\"But, Selene\\'s education was regulated by different views, and\\nconducted upon severer principles; if that can be called severity\\nwhich opens the mind to a sense of moral and religious duties, and\\nmost effectually arms it against the inevitable evils of\\nlife.\"--Mr. Day\\'s \"Sandford and Merton,\" Volume 3.)\\n\\nBut should it be proved that woman is naturally weaker than man,\\nfrom whence does it follow that it is natural for her to labour to\\nbecome still weaker than nature intended her to be?  Arguments of\\nthis cast are an insult to common sense, and savour of passion.\\nThe DIVINE RIGHT of husbands, like the divine right of kings, may,\\nit is to be hoped, in this enlightened age, be contested without\\ndanger, and though conviction may not silence many boisterous\\ndisputants, yet, when any prevailing prejudice is attacked, the\\nwise will consider, and leave the narrow-minded to rail with\\nthoughtless vehemence at innovation.\\n\\nThe mother, who wishes to give true dignity of character to her\\ndaughter, must, regardless of the sneers of ignorance, proceed on a\\nplan diametrically opposite to that which Rousseau has recommended\\nwith all the deluding charms of eloquence and philosophical\\nsophistry:  for his eloquence renders absurdities plausible, and\\nhis dogmatic conclusions puzzle, without convincing those who have\\nnot ability to refute them.\\n\\nThroughout the whole animal kingdom every young creature requires\\nalmost continual exercise, and the infancy of children, conformable\\nto this intimation, should be passed in harmless gambols, that\\nexercise the feet and hands, without requiring very minute\\ndirection from the head, or the constant attention of a nurse.  In\\nfact, the care necessary for self-preservation is the first natural\\nexercise of the understanding, as little inventions to amuse the\\npresent moment unfold the imagination.  But these wise designs of\\nnature are counteracted by mistaken fondness or blind zeal.  The\\nchild is not left a moment to its own direction, particularly a\\ngirl, and thus rendered dependent--dependence is called natural.\\n\\nTo preserve personal beauty, woman\\'s glory! the limbs and faculties\\nare cramped with worse than Chinese bands, and the sedentary life\\nwhich they are condemned to live, whilst boys frolic in the open\\nair, weakens the muscles and relaxes the nerves.  As for Rousseau\\'s\\nremarks, which have since been echoed by several writers, that they\\nhave naturally, that is from their birth, independent of education,\\na fondness for dolls, dressing, and talking, they are so puerile as\\nnot to merit a serious refutation.  That a girl, condemned to sit\\nfor hours together listening to the idle chat of weak nurses or to\\nattend at her mother\\'s toilet, will endeavour to join the\\nconversation, is, indeed very natural; and that she will imitate\\nher mother or aunts, and amuse herself by adorning her lifeless\\ndoll, as they do in dressing her, poor innocent babe! is\\nundoubtedly a most natural consequence.  For men of the greatest\\nabilities have seldom had sufficient strength to rise above the\\nsurrounding atmosphere; and, if the page of genius has always been\\nblurred by the prejudices of the age, some allowance should be made\\nfor a sex, who, like kings, always see things through a false\\nmedium.\\n\\nIn this manner may the fondness for dress, conspicuous in women, be\\neasily accounted for, without supposing it the result of a desire\\nto please the sex on which they are dependent.  The absurdity, in\\nshort, of supposing that a girl is naturally a coquette, and that a\\ndesire connected with the impulse of nature to propagate the\\nspecies, should appear even before an improper education has, by\\nheating the imagination, called it forth prematurely, is so\\nunphilosophical, that such a sagacious observer as Rousseau would\\nnot have adopted it, if he had not been accustomed to make reason\\ngive way to his desire of singularity, and truth to a favourite\\nparadox.\\n\\nYet thus to give a sex to mind was not very consistent with the\\nprinciples of a man who argued so warmly, and so well, for the\\nimmortality of the soul.  But what a weak barrier is truth when it\\nstands in the way of an hypothesis!  Rousseau respected--almost\\nadored virtue--and yet allowed himself to love with sensual\\nfondness.  His imagination constantly prepared inflammable fuel for\\nhis inflammable senses; but, in order to reconcile his respect for\\nself-denial, fortitude and those heroic virtues, which a mind like\\nhis could not coolly admire, he labours to invert the law of\\nnature, and broaches a doctrine pregnant with mischief, and\\nderogatory to the character of supreme wisdom.\\n\\nHis ridiculous stories, which tend to prove that girls are\\nNATURALLY attentive to their persons, without laying any stress on\\ndaily example, are below contempt.  And that a little miss should\\nhave such a correct taste as to neglect the pleasing amusement of\\nmaking O\\'s, merely because she perceived that it was an ungraceful\\nattitude, should be selected with the anecdotes of the learned\\npig.*\\n\\n(*Footnote.  \"I once knew a young person who learned to write\\nbefore she learned to read, and began to write with her needle\\nbefore she could use a pen.  At first indeed, she took it into her\\nhead to make no other letter than the O:  this letter she was\\nconstantly making of all sizes, and always the wrong way.\\nUnluckily one day, as she was intent on this employment, she\\nhappened to see herself in the looking glass; when, taking a\\ndislike to the constrained attitude in which she sat while writing,\\nshe threw away her pen, like another Pallas, and determined against\\nmaking the O any more.  Her brother was also equally averse to\\nwriting:  it was the confinement, however, and not the constrained\\nattitude, that most disgusted him.\"\\nRousseau\\'s \"Emilius.\")\\n\\nI have, probably, had an opportunity of observing more girls in\\ntheir infancy than J. J. Rousseau.  I can recollect my own\\nfeelings, and I have looked steadily around me; yet, so far from\\ncoinciding with him in opinion respecting the first dawn of the\\nfemale character, I will venture to affirm, that a girl, whose\\nspirits have not been damped by inactivity, or innocence tainted by\\nfalse shame, will always be a romp, and the doll will never excite\\nattention unless confinement allows her no alternative.  Girls and\\nboys, in short, would play harmless together, if the distinction of\\nsex was not inculcated long before nature makes any difference.  I\\nwill, go further, and affirm, as an indisputable fact, that most of\\nthe women, in the circle of my observation, who have acted like\\nrational creatures, or shown any vigour of intellect, have\\naccidentally been allowed to run wild, as some of the elegant\\nformers of the fair sex would insinuate.\\n\\nThe baneful consequences which flow from inattention to health\\nduring infancy, and youth, extend further than is supposed,\\ndependence of body naturally produces dependence of mind; and how\\ncan she be a good wife or mother, the greater part of whose time is\\nemployed to guard against or endure sickness; nor can it be\\nexpected, that a woman will resolutely endeavour to strengthen her\\nconstitution and abstain from enervating indulgences, if artificial\\nnotions of beauty, and false descriptions of sensibility, have been\\nearly entangled with her motives of action.  Most men are sometimes\\nobliged to bear with bodily inconveniences, and to endure,\\noccasionally, the inclemency of the elements; but genteel women\\nare, literally speaking, slaves to their bodies, and glory in their\\nsubjection.\\n\\nI once knew a weak woman of fashion, who was more than commonly\\nproud of her delicacy and sensibility.  She thought a\\ndistinguishing taste and puny appetite the height of all human\\nperfection, and acted accordingly.  I have seen this weak\\nsophisticated being neglect all the duties of life, yet recline\\nwith self-complacency on a sofa, and boast of her want of appetite\\nas a proof of delicacy that extended to, or, perhaps, arose from,\\nher exquisite sensibility:  for it is difficult to render\\nintelligible such ridiculous jargon.  Yet, at the moment, I have\\nseen her insult a worthy old gentlewoman, whom unexpected\\nmisfortunes had made dependent on her ostentatious bounty, and who,\\nin better days, had claims on her gratitude.  Is it possible that a\\nhuman creature should have become such a weak and depraved being,\\nif, like the Sybarites, dissolved in luxury, every thing like\\nvirtue had not been worn away, or never impressed by precept, a\\npoor substitute it is true, for cultivation of mind, though it\\nserves as a fence against vice?\\n\\nSuch a woman is not a more irrational monster than some of the\\nRoman emperors, who were depraved by lawless power.  Yet, since\\nkings have been more under the restraint of law, and the curb,\\nhowever weak, of honour, the records of history are not filled with\\nsuch unnatural instances of folly and cruelty, nor does the\\ndespotism that kills virtue and genius in the bud, hover over\\nEurope with that destructive blast which desolates Turkey, and\\nrenders the men, as well as the soil unfruitful.\\n\\nWomen are every where in this deplorable state; for, in order to\\npreserve their innocence, as ignorance is courteously termed, truth\\nis hidden from them, and they are made to assume an artificial\\ncharacter before their faculties have acquired any strength.\\nTaught from their infancy, that beauty is woman\\'s sceptre, the mind\\nshapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only\\nseeks to adorn its prison.  Men have various employments and\\npursuits which engage their attention, and give a character to the\\nopening mind; but women, confined to one, and having their thoughts\\nconstantly directed to the most insignificant part of themselves,\\nseldom extend their views beyond the triumph of the hour.  But was\\ntheir understanding once emancipated from the slavery to which the\\npride and sensuality of man and their short sighted desire, like\\nthat of dominion in tyrants, of present sway, has subjected them,\\nwe should probably read of their weaknesses with surprise.  I must\\nbe allowed to pursue the argument a little farther.\\n\\nPerhaps, if the existence of an evil being was allowed, who, in the\\nallegorical language of scripture, went about seeking whom he\\nshould devour, he could not more effectually degrade the human\\ncharacter than by giving a man absolute power.\\n\\nThis argument branches into various ramifications.  Birth, riches,\\nand every intrinsic advantage that exalt a man above his fellows,\\nwithout any mental exertion, sink him in reality below them.  In\\nproportion to his weakness, he is played upon by designing men,\\ntill the bloated monster has lost all traces of humanity.  And that\\ntribes of men, like flocks of sheep, should quietly follow such a\\nleader, is a solecism that only a desire of present enjoyment and\\nnarrowness of understanding can solve.  Educated in slavish\\ndependence, and enervated by luxury and sloth, where shall we find\\nmen who will stand forth to assert the rights of man; or claim the\\nprivilege of moral beings, who should have but one road to\\nexcellence? Slavery to monarchs and ministers, which the world will\\nbe long in freeing itself from, and whose deadly grasp stops the\\nprogress of the human mind, is not yet abolished.\\n\\nLet not men then in the pride of power, use the same arguments that\\ntyrannic kings and venal ministers have used, and fallaciously\\nassert, that woman ought to be subjected because she has always\\nbeen so.  But, when man, governed by reasonable laws, enjoys his\\nnatural freedom, let him despise woman, if she do not share it with\\nhim; and, till that glorious period arrives, in descanting on the\\nfolly of the sex, let him not overlook his own.\\n\\nWomen, it is true, obtaining power by unjust means, by practising\\nor fostering vice, evidently lose the rank which reason would\\nassign them, and they become either abject slaves or capricious\\ntyrants.  They lose all simplicity, all dignity of mind, in\\nacquiring power, and act as men are observed to act when they have\\nbeen exalted by the same means.\\n\\nIt is time to effect a revolution in female manners, time to\\nrestore to them their lost dignity, and make them, as a part of the\\nhuman species, labour by reforming themselves to reform the world.\\nIt is time to separate unchangeable morals from local manners.  If\\nmen be demi-gods, why let us serve them!  And if the dignity of the\\nfemale soul be as disputable as that of animals, if their reason\\ndoes not afford sufficient light to direct their conduct whilst\\nunerring instinct is denied, they are surely of all creatures the\\nmost miserable and, bent beneath the iron hand of destiny, must\\nsubmit to be a FAIR DEFECT in creation.  But to justify the ways of\\nprovidence respecting them, by pointing out some irrefragable\\nreason for thus making such a large portion of mankind accountable\\nand not accountable, would puzzle the subtlest casuist.\\n\\nThe only solid foundation for morality appears to be the character\\nof the Supreme Being; the harmony of which arises from a balance of\\nattributes; and, to speak with reverence, one attribute seems to\\nimply the NECESSITY of another.  He must be just, because he is\\nwise, he must be good, because he is omnipotent.  For, to exalt one\\nattribute at the expense of another equally noble and necessary,\\nbears the stamp of the warped reason of man, the homage of passion.\\nMan, accustomed to bow down to power in his savage state, can\\nseldom divest himself of this barbarous prejudice even when\\ncivilization determines how much superior mental is to bodily\\nstrength; and his reason is clouded by these crude opinions, even\\nwhen he thinks of the Deity.  His omnipotence is made to swallow\\nup, or preside over his other attributes, and those mortals are\\nsupposed to limit his power irreverently, who think that it must be\\nregulated by his wisdom.\\n\\nI disclaim that species of humility which, after investigating\\nnature, stops at the author.  The high and lofty One, who\\ninhabiteth eternity, doubtless possesses many attributes of which\\nwe can form no conception; but reason tells me that they cannot\\nclash with those I adore, and I am compelled to listen to her\\nvoice.\\n\\nIt seems natural for man to search for excellence, and either to\\ntrace it in the object that he worships, or blindly to invest it\\nwith perfection as a garment.  But what good effect can the latter\\nmode of worship have on the moral conduct of a rational being?  He\\nbends to power; he adores a dark cloud, which may open a bright\\nprospect to him, or burst in angry, lawless fury on his devoted\\nhead, he knows not why.  And, supposing that the Deity acts from\\nthe vague impulse of an undirected will, man must also follow his\\nown, or act according to rules, deduced from principles which he\\ndisclaims as irreverent.  Into this dilemma have both enthusiasts\\nand cooler thinkers fallen, when they laboured to free men from the\\nwholesome restraints which a just conception of the character of\\nGod imposes.\\n\\nIt is not impious thus to scan the attributes of the Almighty:  in\\nfact, who can avoid it that exercises his faculties? for to love\\nGod as the fountain of wisdom, goodness, and power, appears to be\\nthe only worship useful to a being who wishes to acquire either\\nvirtue or knowledge.  A blind unsettled affection may, like human\\npassions, occupy the mind and warm the heart, whilst, to do\\njustice, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God, is forgotten.  I\\nshall pursue this subject still further, when I consider religion\\nin a light opposite to that recommended by Dr. Gregory, who treats\\nit as a matter of sentiment or taste.\\n\\nTo return from this apparent digression.  It were to be wished,\\nthat women would cherish an affection for their husbands, founded\\non the same principle that devotion ought to rest upon.  No other\\nfirm base is there under heaven, for let them beware of the\\nfallacious light of sentiment; too often used as a softer phrase\\nfor sensuality.  It follows then, I think, that from their infancy\\nwomen should either be shut up like eastern princes, or educated in\\nsuch a manner as to be able to think and act for themselves.\\n\\nWhy do men halt between two opinions, and expect impossibilities?\\nWhy do they expect virtue from a slave, or from a being whom the\\nconstitution of civil society has rendered weak, if not vicious?\\n\\nStill I know that it will require a considerable length of time to\\neradicate the firmly rooted prejudices which sensualists have\\nplanted; it will also require some time to convince women that they\\nact contrary to their real interest on an enlarged scale, when they\\ncherish or affect weakness under the name of delicacy, and to\\nconvince the world that the poisoned source of female vices and\\nfollies, if it be necessary, in compliance with custom, to use\\nsynonymous terms in a lax sense, has been the sensual homage paid\\nto beauty:  to beauty of features; for it has been shrewdly\\nobserved by a German writer, that a pretty woman, as an object of\\ndesire, is generally allowed to be so by men of all descriptions;\\nwhilst a fine woman, who inspires more sublime emotions by\\ndisplaying intellectual beauty, may be overlooked or observed with\\nindifference, by those men who find their happiness in the\\ngratification of their appetites.  I foresee an obvious retort;\\nwhilst man remains such an imperfect being as he appears hitherto\\nto have been, he will, more or less, be the slave of his appetites;\\nand those women obtaining most power who gratify a predominant one,\\nthe sex is degraded by a physical, if not by a moral necessity.\\n\\nThis objection has, I grant, some force; but while such a sublime\\nprecept exists, as, \"be pure as your heavenly father is pure;\" it\\nwould seem that the virtues of man are not limited by the Being who\\nalone could limit them; and that he may press forward without\\nconsidering whether he steps out of his sphere by indulging such a\\nnoble ambition.  To the wild billows it has been said, \"thus far\\nshalt thou go, and no further; and here shall thy proud waves be\\nstayed.\"  Vainly then do they beat and foam, restrained by the\\npower that confines the struggling planets within their orbits,\\nmatter yields to the great governing Spirit.  But an immortal soul,\\nnot restrained by mechanical laws, and struggling to free itself\\nfrom the shackles of matter, contributes to, instead of disturbing,\\nthe order of creation, when, co-operating with the Father of\\nspirits, it tries to govern itself by the invariable rule that, in\\na degree, before which our imagination faints, the universe is\\nregulated.\\n\\nBesides, if women are educated for dependence, that is, to act\\naccording to the will of another fallible being, and submit, right\\nor wrong, to power, where are we to stop?  Are they to be\\nconsidered as viceregents, allowed to reign over a small domain,\\nand answerable for their conduct to a higher tribunal, liable to\\nerror?\\n\\nIt will not be difficult to prove, that such delegates will act\\nlike men subjected by fear, and make their children and servants\\nendure their tyrannical oppression.  As they submit without reason,\\nthey will, having no fixed rules to square their conduct by, be\\nkind or cruel, just as the whim of the moment directs; and we ought\\nnot to wonder if sometimes, galled by their heavy yoke, they take a\\nmalignant pleasure in resting it on weaker shoulders.\\n\\nBut, supposing a woman, trained up to obedience, be married to a\\nsensible man, who directs her judgment, without making her feel the\\nservility of her subjection, to act with as much propriety by this\\nreflected light as can be expected when reason is taken at second\\nhand, yet she cannot ensure the life of her protector; he may die\\nand leave her with a large family.\\n\\nA double duty devolves on her; to educate them in the character of\\nboth father and mother; to form their principles and secure their\\nproperty.  But, alas! she has never thought, much less acted for\\nherself.  She has only learned to please men, to depend gracefully\\non them; yet, encumbered with children, how is she to obtain\\nanother protector; a husband to supply the place of reason?  A\\nrational man, for we are not treading on romantic ground, though he\\nmay think her a pleasing docile creature, will not choose to marry\\na FAMILY for love, when the world contains many more pretty\\ncreatures.  What is then to become of her?  She either falls an\\neasy prey to some mean fortune hunter, who defrauds her children of\\ntheir paternal inheritance, and renders her miserable; or becomes\\nthe victim of discontent and blind indulgence.  Unable to educate\\nher sons, or impress them with respect; for it is not a play on\\nwords to assert, that people are never respected, though filling an\\nimportant station, who are not respectable; she pines under the\\nanguish of unavailing impotent regret.  The serpent\\'s tooth enters\\ninto her very soul, and the vices of licentious youth bring her\\nwith sorrow, if not with poverty also, to the grave.\\n\\nThis is not an overcharged picture; on the contrary, it is a very\\npossible case, and something similar must have fallen under every\\nattentive eye.\\n\\nI have, however, taken it for granted, that she was well disposed,\\nthough experience shows, that the blind may as easily be led into a\\nditch as along the beaten road.  But supposing, no very improbable\\nconjecture, that a being only taught to please must still find her\\nhappiness in pleasing; what an example of folly, not to say vice,\\nwill she be to her innocent daughters!  The mother will be lost in\\nthe coquette, and, instead of making friends of her daughters, view\\nthem with eyes askance, for they are rivals--rivals more cruel than\\nany other, because they invite a comparison, and drive her from the\\nthrone of beauty, who has never thought of a seat on the bench of\\nreason.\\n\\nIt does not require a lively pencil, or the discriminating outline\\nof a caricature, to sketch the domestic miseries and petty vices\\nwhich such a mistress of a family diffuses.  Still she only acts as\\na woman ought to act, brought up according to Rousseau\\'s system.\\nShe can never be reproached for being masculine, or turning out of\\nher sphere; nay, she may observe another of his grand rules, and,\\ncautiously preserving her reputation free from spot, be reckoned a\\ngood kind of woman.  Yet in what respect can she be termed good?\\nShe abstains, it is true, without any great struggle, from\\ncommitting gross crimes; but how does she fulfil her duties?\\nDuties!--in truth she has enough to think of to adorn her body and\\nnurse a weak constitution.\\n\\nWith respect to religion, she never presumed to judge for herself;\\nbut conformed, as a dependent creature should, to the ceremonies of\\nthe church which she was brought up in, piously believing, that\\nwiser heads than her own have settled that business:  and not to\\ndoubt is her point of perfection.  She therefore pays her tythe of\\nmint and cummin, and thanks her God that she is not as other women\\nare.  These are the blessed effects of a good education! these the\\nvirtues of man\\'s helpmate.  I must relieve myself by drawing a\\ndifferent picture.\\n\\nLet fancy now present a woman with a tolerable understanding, for I\\ndo not wish to leave the line of mediocrity, whose constitution,\\nstrengthened by exercise, has allowed her body to acquire its full\\nvigour; her mind, at the same time, gradually expanding itself to\\ncomprehend the moral duties of life, and in what human virtue and\\ndignity consist.  Formed thus by the relative duties of her\\nstation, she marries from affection, without losing sight of\\nprudence, and looking beyond matrimonial felicity, she secures her\\nhusband\\'s respect before it is necessary to exert mean arts to\\nplease him, and feed a dying flame, which nature doomed to expire\\nwhen the object became familiar, when friendship and forbearance\\ntake place of a more ardent affection.  This is the natural death\\nof love, and domestic peace is not destroyed by struggles to\\nprevent its extinction.  I also suppose the husband to be virtuous;\\nor she is still more in want of independent principles.\\n\\nFate, however, breaks this tie.  She is left a widow, perhaps,\\nwithout a sufficient provision:  but she is not desolate!  The pang\\nof nature is felt; but after time has softened sorrow into\\nmelancholy resignation, her heart turns to her children with\\nredoubled fondness, and anxious to provide for them, affection\\ngives a sacred heroic cast to her maternal duties.  She thinks that\\nnot only the eye sees her virtuous efforts, from whom all her\\ncomfort now must flow, and whose approbation is life; but her\\nimagination, a little abstracted and exalted by grief, dwells on\\nthe fond hope, that the eyes which her trembling hand closed, may\\nstill see how she subdues every wayward passion to fulfil the\\ndouble duty of being the father as well as the mother of her\\nchildren.  Raised to heroism by misfortunes, she represses the\\nfirst faint dawning of a natural inclination, before it ripens into\\nlove, and in the bloom of life forgets her sex--forgets the\\npleasure of an awakening passion, which might again have been\\ninspired and returned.  She no longer thinks of pleasing, and\\nconscious dignity prevents her from priding herself on account of\\nthe praise which her conduct demands.  Her children have her love,\\nand her brightest hopes are beyond the grave, where her imagination\\noften strays.\\n\\nI think I see her surrounded by her children, reaping the reward of\\nher care.  The intelligent eye meets her\\'s, whilst health and\\ninnocence smile on their chubby cheeks, and as they grow up the\\ncares of life are lessened by their grateful attention.  She lives\\nto see the virtues which she endeavoured to plant on principles,\\nfixed into habits, to see her children attain a strength of\\ncharacter sufficient to enable them to endure adversity without\\nforgetting their mother\\'s example.\\n\\nThe task of life thus fulfilled, she calmly waits for the sleep of\\ndeath, and rising from the grave may say, behold, thou gavest me a\\ntalent, and here are five talents.\\n\\nI wish to sum up what I have said in a few words, for I here throw\\ndown my gauntlet, and deny the existence of sexual virtues, not\\nexcepting modesty.  For man and woman, truth, if I understand the\\nmeaning of the word, must be the same; yet the fanciful female\\ncharacter, so prettily drawn by poets and novelists, demanding the\\nsacrifice of truth and sincerity, virtue becomes a relative idea,\\nhaving no other foundation than utility, and of that utility men\\npretend arbitrarily to judge, shaping it to their own convenience.\\n\\nWomen, I allow, may have different duties to fulfil; but they are\\nHUMAN duties, and the principles that should regulate the discharge\\nof them, I sturdily maintain, must be the same.\\n\\nTo become respectable, the exercise of their understanding is\\nnecessary, there is no other foundation for independence of\\ncharacter; I mean explicitly to say, that they must only bow to the\\nauthority of reason, instead of being the MODEST slaves of opinion.\\n\\nIn the superior ranks of life how seldom do we meet with a man of\\nsuperior abilities, or even common acquirements?  The reason\\nappears to me clear; the state they are born in was an unnatural\\none.  The human character has ever been formed by the employments\\nthe individual, or class pursues; and if the faculties are not\\nsharpened by necessity, they must remain obtuse.  The argument may\\nfairly be extended to women; for seldom occupied by serious\\nbusiness, the pursuit of pleasure gives that insignificancy to\\ntheir character which renders the society of the GREAT so insipid.\\nThe same want of firmness, produced by a similar cause, forces them\\nboth to fly from themselves to noisy pleasures, and artificial\\npassions, till vanity takes place of every social affection, and\\nthe characteristics of humanity can scarcely be discerned.  Such\\nare the blessings of civil governments, as they are at present\\norganized, that wealth and female softness equally tend to debase\\nmankind, and are produced by the same cause; but allowing women to\\nbe rational creatures they should be incited to acquire virtues\\nwhich they may call their own, for how can a rational being be\\nennobled by any thing that is not obtained by its OWN exertions?\\n\\n',\n",

It is vain to expect\\nvirtue from women till they are, in some degree, independent of\\nmen; nay, it is vain to expect that strength of natural affection,\\nwhich would make them good wives and good mothers.  Whilst they are\\nabsolutely dependent on their husbands, they will be cunning, mean,\\nand selfish, and the men who can be gratified by the fawning\\nfondness, of spaniel-like affection, have not much delicacy, for\\nlove is not to be bought, in any sense of the word, its silken\\nwings are instantly shrivelled up when any thing beside a return in\\nkind is sought.  Yet whilst wealth enervates men; and women live,\\nas it were, by their personal charms, how, can we expect them to\\ndischarge those ennobling duties which equally require exertion and\\nself-denial.  Hereditary property sophisticates the mind, and the\\nunfortunate victims to it, if I may so express myself, swathed from\\ntheir birth, seldom exert the locomotive faculty of body or mind;\\nand, thus viewing every thing through one medium, and that a false\\none, they are unable to discern in what true merit and happiness\\nconsist.  False, indeed, must be the light when the drapery of\\nsituation hides the man, and makes him stalk in masquerade,\\ndragging from one scene of dissipation to another the nerveless\\nlimbs that hang with stupid listlessness, and rolling round the\\nvacant eye which plainly tells us that there is no mind at home.\\n\\nI mean, therefore, to infer, that the society is not properly\\norganized which does not compel men and women to discharge their\\nrespective duties, by making it the only way to acquire that\\ncountenance from their fellow creatures, which every human being\\nwishes some way to attain.  The respect, consequently, which is\\npaid to wealth and mere personal charms, is a true north-east\\nblast, that blights the tender blossoms of affection and virtue.\\nNature has wisely attached affections to duties, to sweeten toil,\\nand to give that vigour to the exertions of reason which only the\\nheart can give.  But, the affection which is put on merely because\\nit is the appropriated insignia of a certain character, when its\\nduties are not fulfilled is one of the empty compliments which vice\\nand folly are obliged to pay to virtue and the real nature of\\nthings.\\n\\nTo illustrate my opinion, I need only observe, that when a woman is\\nadmired for her beauty, and suffers herself to be so far\\nintoxicated by the admiration she receives, as to neglect to\\ndischarge the indispensable duty of a mother, she sins against\\nherself by neglecting to cultivate an affection that would equally\\ntend to make her useful and happy.  True happiness, I mean all the\\ncontentment, and virtuous satisfaction that can be snatched in this\\nimperfect state, must arise from well regulated affections; and an\\naffection includes a duty.  Men are not aware of the misery they\\ncause, and the vicious weakness they cherish, by only inciting\\nwomen to render themselves pleasing; they do not consider, that\\nthey thus make natural and artificial duties clash, by sacrificing\\nthe comfort and respectability of a woman\\'s life to voluptuous\\nnotions of beauty, when in nature they all harmonize.\\n\\nCold would be the heart of a husband, were he not rendered\\nunnatural by early debauchery, who did not feel more delight at\\nseeing his child suckled by its mother, than the most artful wanton\\ntricks could ever raise; yet this natural way of cementing the\\nmatrimonial tie, and twisting esteem with fonder recollections,\\nwealth leads women to spurn.  To preserve their beauty, and wear\\nthe flowery crown of the day, that gives them a kind of right to\\nreign for a short time over the sex, they neglect to stamp\\nimpressions on their husbands\\' hearts, that would be remembered\\nwith more tenderness when the snow on the head began to chill the\\nbosom, than even their virgin charms.  The maternal solicitude of a\\nreasonable affectionate woman is very interesting, and the\\nchastened dignity with which a mother returns the caresses that she\\nand her child receive from a father who has been fulfilling the\\nserious duties of his station, is not only a respectable, but a\\nbeautiful sight.  So singular, indeed, are my feelings, and I have\\nendeavoured not to catch factitious ones, that after having been\\nfatigued with the sight of insipid grandeur and the slavish\\nceremonies that with cumberous pomp supplied the place of domestic\\naffections, I have turned to some other scene to relieve my eye, by\\nresting it on the refreshing green every where scattered by nature.\\nI have then viewed with pleasure a woman nursing her children, and\\ndischarging the duties of her station with, perhaps, merely a\\nservant made to take off her hands the servile part of the\\nhousehold business.  I have seen her prepare herself and children,\\nwith only the luxury of cleanliness, to receive her husband, who\\nreturning weary home in the evening, found smiling babes and a\\nclean hearth.  My heart has loitered in the midst of the group, and\\nhas even throbbed with sympathetic emotion, when the scraping of\\nthe well known foot has raised a pleasing tumult.\\n\\nWhilst my benevolence has been gratified by contemplating this\\nartless picture, I have thought that a couple of this description,\\nequally necessary and independent of each other, because each\\nfulfilled the respective duties of their station, possessed all\\nthat life could give.  Raised sufficiently above abject poverty not\\nto be obliged to weigh the consequence of every farthing they\\nspend, and having sufficient to prevent their attending to a frigid\\nsystem of economy which narrows both heart and mind.  I declare, so\\nvulgar are my conceptions, that I know not what is wanted to render\\nthis the happiest as well as the most respectable situation in the\\nworld, but a taste for literature, to throw a little variety and\\ninterest into social converse, and some superfluous money to give\\nto the needy, and to buy books.  For it is not pleasant when the\\nheart is opened by compassion, and the head active in arranging\\nplans of usefulness, to have a prim urchin continually twitching\\nback the elbow to prevent the hand from drawing out an almost empty\\npurse, whispering at the same time some prudential maxim about the\\npriority of justice.\\n\\nDestructive, however, as riches and inherited honours are to the\\nhuman character, women are more debased and cramped, if possible by\\nthem, than men, because men may still, in some degree, unfold their\\nfaculties by becoming soldiers and statesmen.\\n\\nAs soldiers, I grant, they can now only gather, for the most part,\\nvainglorious laurels, whilst they adjust to a hair the European\\nbalance, taking especial care that no bleak northern nook or sound\\nincline the beam.  But the days of true heroism are over, when a\\ncitizen fought for his country like a Fabricius or a Washington,\\nand then returned to his farm to let his virtuous fervour run in a\\nmore placid, but not a less salutary stream.  No, our British\\nheroes are oftener sent from the gaming table than from the plough;\\nand their passions have been rather inflamed by hanging with dumb\\nsuspense on the turn of a die, than sublimated by panting after the\\nadventurous march of virtue in the historic page.\\n\\nThe statesman, it is true, might with more propriety quit the Faro\\nBank, or card-table, to guide the helm, for he has still but to\\nshuffle and trick.  The whole system of British politics, if system\\nit may courteously be called, consisting in multiplying dependents\\nand contriving taxes which grind the poor to pamper the rich; thus\\na war, or any wild goose chace is, as the vulgar use the phrase, a\\nlucky turn-up of patronage for the minister, whose chief merit is\\nthe art of keeping himself in place.\\n\\nIt is not necessary then that he should have bowels for the poor,\\nso he can secure for his family the odd trick.  Or should some show\\nof respect, for what is termed with ignorant ostentation an\\nEnglishman\\'s birth-right, be expedient to bubble the gruff mastiff\\nthat he has to lead by the nose, he can make an empty show, very\\nsafely, by giving his single voice, and suffering his light\\nsquadron to file off to the other side.  And when a question of\\nhumanity is agitated, he may dip a sop in the milk of human\\nkindness, to silence Cerberus, and talk of the interest which his\\nheart takes in an attempt to make the earth no longer cry for\\nvengeance as it sucks in its children\\'s blood, though his cold hand\\nmay at the very moment rivet their chains, by sanctioning the\\nabominable traffick.  A minister is no longer a minister than while\\nhe can carry a point, which he is determined to carry.  Yet it is\\nnot necessary that a minister should feel like a man, when a bold\\npush might shake his seat.\\n\\nBut, to have done with these episodical observations, let me return\\nto the more specious slavery which chains the very soul of woman,\\nkeeping her for ever under the bondage of ignorance.\\n\\nThe preposterous distinctions of rank, which render civilization a\\ncurse, by dividing the world between voluptuous tyrants, and\\ncunning envious dependents, corrupt, almost equally, every class of\\npeople, because respectability is not attached to the discharge of\\nthe relative duties of life, but to the station, and when the\\nduties are not fulfilled, the affections cannot gain sufficient\\nstrength to fortify the virtue of which they are the natural\\nreward.  Still there are some loop-holes out of which a man may\\ncreep, and dare to think and act for himself; but for a woman it is\\nan herculean task, because she has difficulties peculiar to her sex\\nto overcome, which require almost super-human powers.\\n\\nA truly benevolent legislator always endeavours to make it the\\ninterest of each individual to be virtuous; and thus private virtue\\nbecoming the cement of public happiness, an orderly whole is\\nconsolidated by the tendency of all the parts towards a common\\ncentre.  But, the private or public virtue of women is very\\nproblematical; for Rousseau, and a numerous list of male writers,\\ninsist that she should all her life, be subjected to a severe\\nrestraint, that of propriety.  Why subject her to propriety--blind\\npropriety, if she be capable of acting from a nobler spring, if she\\nbe an heir of immortality?  Is sugar always to be produced by vital\\nblood?  Is one half of the human species, like the poor African\\nslaves, to be subject to prejudices that brutalize them, when\\nprinciples would be a surer guard only to sweeten the cup of man?\\nIs not this indirectly to deny women reason? for a gift is a\\nmockery, if it be unfit for use.\\n\\nWomen are in common with men, rendered weak and luxurious by the\\nrelaxing pleasures which wealth procures; but added to this, they\\nare made slaves to their persons, and must render them alluring,\\nthat man may lend them his reason to guide their tottering steps\\naright.  Or should they be ambitious, they must govern their\\ntyrants by sinister tricks, for without rights there cannot be any\\nincumbent duties.  The laws respecting woman, which I mean to\\ndiscuss in a future part, make an absurd unit of a man and his\\nwife; and then, by the easy transition of only considering him as\\nresponsible, she is reduced to a mere cypher.\\n\\nThe being who discharges the duties of its station, is independent;\\nand, speaking of women at large, their first duty is to themselves\\nas rational creatures, and the next, in point of importance, as\\ncitizens, is that, which includes so many, of a mother.  The rank\\nin life which dispenses with their fulfilling this duty,\\nnecessarily degrades them by making them mere dolls.  Or, should\\nthey turn to something more important than merely fitting drapery\\nupon a smooth block, their minds are only occupied by some soft\\nplatonic attachment; or, the actual management of an intrigue may\\nkeep their thoughts in motion; for when they neglect domestic\\nduties, they have it not in their power to take the field and march\\nand counter-march like soldiers, or wrangle in the senate to keep\\ntheir faculties from rusting.\\n\\nI know, that as a proof of the inferiority of the sex, Rousseau has\\nexultingly exclaimed, How can they leave the nursery for the camp!\\nAnd the camp has by some moralists been termed the school of the\\nmost heroic virtues; though, I think, it would puzzle a keen\\ncasuist to prove the reasonableness of the greater number of wars,\\nthat have dubbed heroes.  I do not mean to consider this question\\ncritically; because, having frequently viewed these freaks of\\nambition as the first natural mode of civilization, when the ground\\nmust be torn up, and the woods cleared by fire and sword, I do not\\nchoose to call them pests; but surely the present system of war,\\nhas little connection with virtue of any denomination, being rather\\nthe school of FINESSE and effeminacy, than of fortitude.\\n\\nYet, if defensive war, the only justifiable war, in the present\\nadvanced state of society, where virtue can show its face and ripen\\namidst the rigours which purify the air on the mountain\\'s top, were\\nalone to be adopted as just and glorious, the true heroism of\\nantiquity might again animate female bosoms.  But fair and softly,\\ngentle reader, male or female, do not alarm thyself, for though I\\nhave contrasted the character of a modern soldier with that of a\\ncivilized woman, I am not going to advise them to turn their\\ndistaff into a musket, though I sincerely wish to see the bayonet\\nconverted into a pruning hook.  I only recreated an imagination,\\nfatigued by contemplating the vices and follies which all proceed\\nfrom a feculent stream of wealth that has muddied the pure rills of\\nnatural affection, by supposing that society will some time or\\nother be so constituted, that man must necessarily fulfil the\\nduties of a citizen, or be despised, and that while he was employed\\nin any of the departments of civil life, his wife, also an active\\ncitizen, should be equally intent to manage her family, educate her\\nchildren, and assist her neighbours.\\n\\nBut, to render her really virtuous and useful, she must not, if she\\ndischarge her civil duties, want, individually, the protection of\\ncivil laws; she must not be dependent on her husband\\'s bounty for\\nher subsistence during his life, or support after his death--for\\nhow can a being be generous who has nothing of its own? or,\\nvirtuous, who is not free?  The wife, in the present state of\\nthings, who is faithful to her husband, and neither suckles nor\\neducates her children, scarcely deserves the name of a wife, and\\nhas no right to that of a citizen.  But take away natural rights,\\nand there is of course an end of duties.\\n\\nWomen thus infallibly become only the wanton solace of men, when\\nthey are so weak in mind and body, that they cannot exert\\nthemselves, unless to pursue some frothy pleasure, or to invent\\nsome frivolous fashion.  What can be a more melancholy sight to a\\nthinking mind, than to look into the numerous carriages that drive\\nhelter-skelter about this metropolis in a morning, full of\\npale-faced creatures who are flying from themselves.  I have often\\nwished, with Dr. Johnson, to place some of them in a little shop,\\nwith half a dozen children looking up to their languid countenances\\nfor support.  I am much mistaken, if some latent vigour would not\\nsoon give health and spirit to their eyes, and some lines drawn by\\nthe exercise of reason on the blank cheeks, which before were only\\nundulated by dimples, might restore lost dignity to the character,\\nor rather enable it to attain the true dignity of its nature.\\nVirtue is not to be acquired even by speculation, much less by the\\nnegative supineness that wealth naturally generates.\\n\\nBesides, when poverty is more disgraceful than even vice, is not\\nmorality cut to the quick?  Still to avoid misconstruction, though\\nI consider that women in the common walks of life are called to\\nfulfil the duties of wives and mothers, by religion and reason, I\\ncannot help lamenting that women of a superiour cast have not a\\nroad open by which they can pursue more extensive plans of\\nusefulness and independence.  I may excite laughter, by dropping an\\nhint, which I mean to pursue, some future time, for I really think\\nthat women ought to have representatives, instead of being\\narbitrarily governed without having any direct share allowed them\\nin the deliberations of government.\\n\\nBut, as the whole system of representation is now, in this country,\\nonly a convenient handle for despotism, they need not complain, for\\nthey are as well represented as a numerous class of hard working\\nmechanics, who pay for the support of royality when they can\\nscarcely stop their children\\'s mouths with bread.  How are they\\nrepresented, whose very sweat supports the splendid stud of an heir\\napparent, or varnishes the chariot of some female favourite who\\nlooks down on shame?  Taxes on the very necessaries of life, enable\\nan endless tribe of idle princes and princesses to pass with stupid\\npomp before a gaping crowd, who almost worship the very parade\\nwhich costs them so dear.  This is mere gothic grandeur, something\\nlike the barbarous, useless parade of having sentinels on horseback\\nat Whitehall, which I could never view without a mixture of\\ncontempt and indignation.\\n\\nHow strangely must the mind be sophisticated when this sort of\\nstate impresses it!  But till these monuments of folly are levelled\\nby virtue, similar follies will leaven the whole mass.  For the\\nsame character, in some degree, will prevail in the aggregate of\\nsociety:  and the refinements of luxury, or the vicious repinings\\nof envious poverty, will equally banish virtue from society,\\nconsidered as the characteristic of that society, or only allow it\\nto appear as one of the stripes of the harlequin coat, worn by the\\ncivilized man.\\n\\nIn the superiour ranks of life, every duty is done by deputies, as\\nif duties could ever be waved, and the vain pleasures which\\nconsequent idleness forces the rich to pursue, appear so enticing\\nto the next rank, that the numerous scramblers for wealth sacrifice\\nevery thing to tread on their heels.  The most sacred trusts are\\nthen considered as sinecures, because they were procured by\\ninterest, and only sought to enable a man to keep GOOD COMPANY.\\nWomen, in particular, all want to be ladies.  Which is simply to\\nhave nothing to do, but listlessly to go they scarcely care where,\\nfor they cannot tell what.\\n\\nBut what have women to do in society?  I may be asked, but to\\nloiter with easy grace; surely you would not condemn them all to\\nsuckle fools, and chronicle small beer!  No.  Women might certainly\\nstudy the art of healing, and be physicians as well as nurses.  And\\nmidwifery, decency seems to allot to them, though I am afraid the\\nword midwife, in our dictionaries, will soon give place to\\naccoucheur, and one proof of the former delicacy of the sex be\\neffaced from the language.\\n\\nThey might, also study politics, and settle their benevolence on\\nthe broadest basis; for the reading of history will scarcely be\\nmore useful than the perusal of romances, if read as mere\\nbiography; if the character of the times, the political\\nimprovements, arts, etc. be not observed.  In short, if it be not\\nconsidered as the history of man; and not of particular men, who\\nfilled a niche in the temple of fame, and dropped into the black\\nrolling stream of time, that silently sweeps all before it, into\\nthe shapeless void called eternity.  For shape can it be called,\\n\"that shape hath none?\"\\n\\nBusiness of various kinds, they might likewise pursue, if they were\\neducated in a more orderly manner, which might save many from\\ncommon and legal prostitution.  Women would not then marry for a\\nsupport, as men accept of places under government, and neglect the\\nimplied duties; nor would an attempt to earn their own subsistence,\\na most laudable one! sink them almost to the level of those poor\\nabandoned creatures who live by prostitution.  For are not\\nmilliners and mantuamakers reckoned the next class?  The few\\nemployments open to women, so far from being liberal, are menial;\\nand when a superior education enables them to take charge of the\\neducation of children as governesses, they are not treated like the\\ntutors of sons, though even clerical tutors are not always treated\\nin a manner calculated to render them respectable in the eyes of\\ntheir pupils, to say nothing of the private comfort of the\\nindividual.  But as women educated like gentlewomen, are never\\ndesigned for the humiliating situation which necessity sometimes\\nforces them to fill; these situations are considered in the light\\nof a degradation; and they know little of the human heart, who need\\nto be told, that nothing so painfully sharpens the sensibility as\\nsuch a fall in life.\\n\\nSome of these women might be restrained from marrying by a proper\\nspirit or delicacy, and others may not have had it in their power\\nto escape in this pitiful way from servitude; is not that\\ngovernment then very defective, and very unmindful of the happiness\\nof one half of its members, that does not provide for honest,\\nindependent women, by encouraging them to fill respectable\\nstations?  But in order to render their private virtue a public\\nbenefit, they must have a civil existence in the state, married or\\nsingle; else we shall continually see some worthy woman, whose\\nsensibility has been rendered painfully acute by undeserved\\ncontempt, droop like \"the lily broken down by a plough share.\"\\n\\nIt is a melancholy truth; yet such is the blessed effects of\\ncivilization! the most respectable women are the most oppressed;\\nand, unless they have understandings far superiour to the common\\nrun of understandings, taking in both sexes, they must, from being\\ntreated like contemptible beings, become contemptible.  How many\\nwomen thus waste life away, the prey of discontent, who might have\\npractised as physicians, regulated a farm, managed a shop, and\\nstood erect, supported by their own industry, instead of hanging\\ntheir heads surcharged with the dew of sensibility, that consumes\\nthe beauty to which it at first gave lustre; nay, I doubt whether\\npity and love are so near a-kin as poets feign, for I have seldom\\nseen much compassion excited by the helplessness of females, unless\\nthey were fair; then, perhaps, pity was the soft handmaid of love,\\nor the harbinger of lust.\\n\\nHow much more respectable is the woman who earns her own bread by\\nfulfilling any duty, than the most accomplished beauty!  beauty did\\nI say? so sensible am I of the beauty of moral loveliness, or the\\nharmonious propriety that attunes the passions of a well-regulated\\nmind, that I blush at making the comparison; yet I sigh to think\\nhow few women aim at attaining this respectability, by withdrawing\\nfrom the giddy whirl of pleasure, or the indolent calm that\\nstupifies the good sort of women it sucks in.\\n\\nProud of their weakness, however, they must always be protected,\\nguarded from care, and all the rough toils that dignify the mind.\\nIf this be the fiat of fate, if they will make themselves\\ninsignificant and contemptible, sweetly to waste \"life away,\" let\\nthem not expect to be valued when their beauty fades, for it is the\\nfate of the fairest flowers to be admired and pulled to pieces by\\nthe careless hand that plucked them.  In how many ways do I wish,\\nfrom the purest benevolence, to impress this truth on my sex; yet I\\nfear that they will not listen to a truth, that dear-bought\\nexperience has brought home to many an agitated bosom, nor\\nwillingly resign the privileges of rank and sex for the privileges\\nof humanity, to which those have no claim who do not discharge its\\nduties.\\n\\nThose writers are particularly useful, in my opinion, who make man\\nfeel for man, independent of the station he fills, or the drapery\\nof factitious sentiments.  I then would fain convince reasonable\\nmen of the importance of some of my remarks and prevail on them to\\nweigh dispassionately the whole tenor of my observations.  I appeal\\nto their understandings; and, as a fellow-creature claim, in the\\nname of my sex, some interest in their hearts.  I entreat them to\\nassist to emancipate their companion to make her a help meet for\\nthem!\\n\\nWould men but generously snap our chains, and be content with\\nrational fellowship, instead of slavish obedience, they would find\\nus more observant daughters, more affectionate sisters, more\\nfaithful wives, more reasonable mothers--in a word, better\\ncitizens.  We should then love them with true affection, because we\\nshould learn to respect ourselves; and the peace of mind of a\\nworthy man would not be interrupted by the idle vanity of his wife,\\nnor his babes sent to nestle in a strange bosom, having never found\\na home in their mother\\'s.\\n\\n',\n",

Is it\\nsurprising, when we consider what a determinate effect an early\\nassociation of ideas has on the character, that they neglect their\\nunderstandings, and turn all their attention to their persons?\\n\\nThe great advantages which naturally result from storing the mind\\nwith knowledge, are obvious from the following considerations.  The\\nassociation of our ideas is either habitual or instantaneous; and\\nthe latter mode seems rather to depend on the original temperature\\nof the mind than on the will.  When the ideas, and matters of fact,\\nare once taken in, they lie by for use, till some fortuitous\\ncircumstance makes the information dart into the mind with\\nillustrative force, that has been received at very different\\nperiods of our lives.  Like the lightning\\'s flash are many\\nrecollections; one idea assimilating and explaining another, with\\nastonishing rapidity.  I do not now allude to that quick perception\\nof truth, which is so intuitive that it baffles research, and makes\\nus at a loss to determine whether it is reminiscence or\\nratiocination, lost sight of in its celerity, that opens the dark\\ncloud.  Over those instantaneous associations we have little power;\\nfor when the mind is once enlarged by excursive flights, or\\nprofound reflection, the raw materials, will, in some degree,\\narrange themselves.  The understanding, it is true, may keep us\\nfrom going out of drawing when we group our thoughts, or transcribe\\nfrom the imagination the warm sketches of fancy; but the animal\\nspirits, the individual character give the colouring.  Over this\\nsubtile electric fluid,* how little power do we possess, and over\\nit how little power can reason obtain!  These fine intractable\\nspirits appear to be the essence of genius, and beaming in its\\neagle eye, produce in the most eminent degree the happy energy of\\nassociating thoughts that surprise, delight, and instruct.  These\\nare the glowing minds that concentrate pictures for their\\nfellow-creatures; forcing them to view with interest the objects\\nreflected from the impassioned imagination, which they passed over\\nin nature.\\n\\n(*Footnote.  I have sometimes, when inclined to laugh at\\nmaterialists, asked whether, as the most powerful effects in nature\\nare apparently produced by fluids, the magnetic, etc. the passions\\nmight not be fine volatile fluids that embraced humanity, keeping\\nthe more refractory elementary parts together--or whether they were\\nsimply a liquid fire that pervaded the more sluggish materials\\ngiving them life and heat?)\\n\\nI must be allowed to explain myself.  The generality of people\\ncannot see or feel poetically, they want fancy, and therefore fly\\nfrom solitude in search of sensible objects; but when an author\\nlends them his eyes, they can see as he saw, and be amused by\\nimages they could not select, though lying before them.\\n\\nEducation thus only supplies the man of genius with knowledge to\\ngive variety and contrast to his associations; but there is an\\nhabitual association of ideas, that grows \"with our growth,\" which\\nhas a great effect on the moral character of mankind; and by which\\na turn is given to the mind, that commonly remains throughout life.\\nSo ductile is the understanding, and yet so stubborn, that the\\nassociations which depend on adventitious circumstances, during the\\nperiod that the body takes to arrive at maturity, can seldom be\\ndisentangled by reason.  One idea calls up another, its old\\nassociate, and memory, faithful to the first impressions,\\nparticularly when the intellectual powers are not employed to cool\\nour sensations, retraces them with mechanical exactness.\\n\\nThis habitual slavery, to first impressions, has a more baneful\\neffect on the female than the male character, because business and\\nother dry employments of the understanding, tend to deaden the\\nfeelings and break associations that do violence to reason.  But\\nfemales, who are made women of when they are mere children, and\\nbrought back to childhood when they ought to leave the go-cart\\nforever, have not sufficient strength of mind to efface the\\nsuperinductions of art that have smothered nature.\\n\\nEvery thing that they see or hear serves to fix impressions, call\\nforth emotions, and associate ideas, that give a sexual character\\nto the mind.  False notions of beauty and delicacy stop the growth\\nof their limbs and produce a sickly soreness, rather than delicacy\\nof organs; and thus weakened by being employed in unfolding instead\\nof examining the first associations, forced on them by every\\nsurrounding object, how can they attain the vigour necessary to\\nenable them to throw off their factitious character?--where find\\nstrength to recur to reason and rise superior to a system of\\noppression, that blasts the fair promises of spring?  This cruel\\nassociation of ideas, which every thing conspires to twist into all\\ntheir habits of thinking, or, to speak with more precision, of\\nfeeling, receives new force when they begin to act a little for\\nthemselves; for they then perceive, that it is only through their\\naddress to excite emotions in men, that pleasure and power are to\\nbe obtained.  Besides, all the books professedly written for their\\ninstruction, which make the first impression on their minds, all\\ninculcate the same opinions.  Educated in worse than Egyptian\\nbondage, it is unreasonable, as well as cruel, to upbraid them with\\nfaults that can scarcely be avoided, unless a degree of native\\nvigour be supposed, that falls to the lot of very few amongst\\nmankind.\\n\\nFor instance, the severest sarcasms have been levelled against the\\nsex, and they have been ridiculed for repeating \"a set of phrases\\nlearnt by rote,\" when nothing could be more natural, considering\\nthe education they receive, and that their \"highest praise is to\\nobey, unargued\"--the will of man.  If they are not allowed to have\\nreason sufficient to govern their own conduct--why, all they\\nlearn--must be learned by rote!  And when all their ingenuity is\\ncalled forth to adjust their dress, \"a passion for a scarlet coat,\"\\nis so natural, that it never surprised me; and, allowing Pope\\'s\\nsummary of their character to be just, \"that every woman is at\\nheart a rake,\" why should they be bitterly censured for seeking a\\ncongenial mind, and preferring a rake to a man of sense?\\n\\nRakes know how to work on their sensibility, whilst the modest\\nmerit of reasonable men has, of course, less effect on their\\nfeelings, and they cannot reach the heart by the way of the\\nunderstanding, because they have few sentiments in common.\\n\\nIt seems a little absurd to expect women to be more reasonable than\\nmen in their LIKINGS, and still to deny them the uncontroled use of\\nreason.  When do men FALL IN LOVE with sense?  When do they, with\\ntheir superior powers and advantages, turn from the person to the\\nmind?  And how can they then expect women, who are only taught to\\nobserve behaviour, and acquire manners rather than morals, to\\ndespise what they have been all their lives labouring to attain?\\nWhere are they suddenly to find judgment enough to weigh patiently\\nthe sense of an awkward virtuous man, when his manners, of which\\nthey are made critical judges, are rebuffing, and his conversation\\ncold and dull, because it does not consist of pretty repartees, or\\nwell-turned compliments?  In order to admire or esteem any thing\\nfor a continuance, we must, at least, have our curiosity excited by\\nknowing, in some degree, what we admire; for we are unable to\\nestimate the value of qualities and virtues above our\\ncomprehension.  Such a respect, when it is felt, may be very\\nsublime; and the confused consciousness of humility may render the\\ndependent creature an interesting object, in some points of view;\\nbut human love must have grosser ingredients; and the person very\\nnaturally will come in for its share--and, an ample share it mostly\\nhas!\\n\\nLove is, in a great degree, an arbitrary passion, and will reign\\nlike some other stalking mischiefs, by its own authority, without\\ndeigning to reason; and it may also be easily distinguished from\\nesteem, the foundation of friendship, because it is often excited\\nby evanescent beauties and graces, though to give an energy to the\\nsentiment something more solid must deepen their impression and set\\nthe imagination to work, to make the most fair-- the first good.\\n\\nCommon passions are excited by common qualities.  Men look for\\nbeauty and the simper of good humoured docility:  women are\\ncaptivated by easy manners: a gentleman-like man seldom fails to\\nplease them, and their thirsty ears eagerly drink the insinuating\\nnothings of politeness, whilst they turn from the unintelligible\\nsounds of the charmer--reason, charm he never so wisely.  With\\nrespect to superficial accomplishments, the rake certainly has the\\nadvantage; and of these, females can form an opinion, for it is\\ntheir own ground.  Rendered gay and giddy by the whole tenor of\\ntheir lives, the very aspect of wisdom, or the severe graces of\\nvirtue must have a lugubrious appearance to them; and produce a\\nkind of restraint from which they and love, sportive child,\\nnaturally revolt.  Without taste, excepting of the lighter kind,\\nfor taste is the offspring of judgment, how can they discover, that\\ntrue beauty and grace must arise from the play of the mind? and how\\ncan they be expected to relish in a lover what they do not, or very\\nimperfectly, possess themselves?  The sympathy that unites hearts,\\nand invites to confidence, in them is so very faint, that it cannot\\ntake fire, and thus mount to passion.  No, I repeat it, the love\\ncherished by such minds, must have grosser fuel!\\n\\nThe inference is obvious; till women are led to exercise their\\nunderstandings, they should not be satirized for their attachment\\nto rakes; nor even for being rakes at heart, when it appears to be\\nthe inevitable consequence of their education.  They who live to\\nplease must find their enjoyments, their happiness, in pleasure!\\nIt is a trite, yet true remark, that we never do any thing well,\\nunless we love it for its own sake.\\n\\nSupposing, however, for a moment, that women were, in some future\\nrevolution of time, to become, what I sincerely wish them to be,\\neven love would acquire more serious dignity, and be purified in\\nits own fires; and virtue giving true delicacy to their affections,\\nthey would turn with disgust from a rake.  Reasoning then, as well\\nas feeling, the only province of woman, at present, they might\\neasily guard against exterior graces, and quickly learn to despise\\nthe sensibility that had been excited and hackneyed in the ways of\\nwomen, whose trade was vice; and allurement\\'s wanton airs.  They\\nwould recollect that the flame, (one must use appropriate\\nexpressions,) which they wished to light up, had been exhausted by\\nlust, and that the sated appetite, losing all relish for pure and\\nsimple pleasures, could only be roused by licentious arts of\\nvariety.  What satisfaction could a woman of delicacy promise\\nherself in a union with such a man, when the very artlessness of\\nher affection might appear insipid?  Thus does Dryden describe the\\nsituation:\\n\\n\"Where love is duty on the female side,\\nOn theirs mere sensual gust, and sought with surly pride.\"\\n\\nBut one grand truth women have yet to learn, though much it imports\\nthem to act accordingly.  In the choice of a husband they should\\nnot be led astray by the qualities of a lover--for a lover the\\nhusband, even supposing him to be wise and virtuous, cannot long\\nremain.\\n\\nWere women more rationally educated, could they take a more\\ncomprehensive view of things, they would be contented to love but\\nonce in their lives; and after marriage calmly let passion subside\\ninto friendship--into that tender intimacy, which is the best\\nrefuge from care; yet is built on such pure, still affections, that\\nidle jealousies would not be allowed to disturb the discharge of\\nthe sober duties of life, nor to engross the thoughts that ought to\\nbe otherwise employed.  This is a state in which many men live; but\\nfew, very few women.  And the difference may easily be accounted\\nfor, without recurring to a sexual character.  Men, for whom we are\\ntold women are made, have too much occupied the thoughts of women;\\nand this association has so entangled love, with all their motives\\nof action; and, to harp a little on an old string, having been\\nsolely employed either to prepare themselves to excite love, or\\nactually putting their lessons in practice, they cannot live\\nwithout love.  But, when a sense of duty, or fear of shame, obliges\\nthem to restrain this pampered desire of pleasing beyond certain\\nlengths, too far for delicacy, it is true, though far from\\ncriminality, they obstinately determine to love, I speak of their\\npassion, their husbands to the end of the chapter--and then acting\\nthe part which they foolishly exacted from their lovers, they\\nbecome abject wooers, and fond slaves.\\n\\nMen of wit and fancy are often rakes; and fancy is the food of\\nlove.  Such men will inspire passion.  Half the sex, in its present\\ninfantine state, would pine for a Lovelace; a man so witty, so\\ngraceful, and so valiant; and can they DESERVE blame for acting\\naccording to principles so constantly inculcated?  They want a\\nlover and protector: and behold him kneeling before them--bravery\\nprostrate to beauty!  The virtues of a husband are thus thrown by\\nlove into the background, and gay hopes, or lively emotions, banish\\nreflection till the day of reckoning comes; and come it surely\\nwill, to turn the sprightly lover into a surly suspicious tyrant,\\nwho contemptuously insults the very weakness he fostered.  Or,\\nsupposing the rake reformed, he cannot quickly get rid of old\\nhabits.  When a man of abilities is first carried away by his\\npassions, it is necessary that sentiment and taste varnish the\\nenormities of vice, and give a zest to brutal indulgences: but when\\nthe gloss of novelty is worn off, and pleasure palls upon the\\nsense, lasciviousness becomes barefaced, and enjoyment only the\\ndesperate effort of weakness flying from reflection as from a\\nlegion of devils.  Oh! virtue, thou art not an empty name!  All\\nthat life can give-- thou givest!\\n\\nIf much comfort cannot be expected from the friendship of a\\nreformed rake of superior abilities, what is the consequence when\\nhe lacketh sense, as well as principles?  Verily misery in its most\\nhideous shape.  When the habits of weak people are consolidated by\\ntime, a reformation is barely possible; and actually makes the\\nbeings miserable who have not sufficient mind to be amused by\\ninnocent pleasure; like the tradesman who retires from the hurry of\\nbusiness, nature presents to them only a universal blank; and the\\nrestless thoughts prey on the damped spirits.  Their reformation as\\nwell as his retirement actually makes them wretched, because it\\ndeprives them of all employment, by quenching the hopes and fears\\nthat set in motion their sluggish minds.\\n\\nIf such be the force of habit; if such be the bondage of folly, how\\ncarefully ought we to guard the mind from storing up vicious\\nassociations; and equally careful should we be to cultivate the\\nunderstanding, to save the poor wight from the weak dependent state\\nof even harmless ignorance.  For it is the right use of reason\\nalone which makes us independent of every thing--excepting the\\nunclouded Reason--\"Whose service is perfect freedom.\"\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nModesty!  Sacred offspring of sensibility and reason! true delicacy\\nof mind! may I unblamed presume to investigate thy nature, and\\ntrace to its covert the mild charm, that mellowing each harsh\\nfeature of a character, renders what would otherwise only inspire\\ncold admiration--lovely!  Thou that smoothest the wrinkles of\\nwisdom, and softenest the tone of the more sublime virtues till\\nthey all melt into humanity! thou that spreadest the ethereal cloud\\nthat surrounding love heightens every beauty, it half shades,\\nbreathing those coy sweets that steal into the heart, and charm the\\nsenses--modulate for me the language of persuasive reason, till I\\nrouse my sex from the flowery bed, on which they supinely sleep\\nlife away!\\n\\nIn speaking of the association of our ideas, I have noticed two\\ndistinct modes; and in defining modesty, it appears to me equally\\nproper to discriminate that purity of mind, which is the effect of\\nchastity, from a simplicity of character that leads us to form a\\njust opinion of ourselves, equally distant from vanity or\\npresumption, though by no means incompatible with a lofty\\nconsciousness of our own dignity.  Modesty in the latter\\nsignification of the term, is that soberness of mind which teaches\\na man not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think,\\nand should be distinguished from humility, because humility is a\\nkind of self-abasement.  A modest man often conceives a great plan,\\nand tenaciously adheres to it, conscious of his own strength, till\\nsuccess gives it a sanction that determines its character.  Milton\\nwas not arrogant when he suffered a suggestion of judgment to\\nescape him that proved a prophesy; nor was General Washington when\\nhe accepted of the command of the American forces.  The latter has\\nalways been characterized as a modest man; but had he been merely\\nhumble, he would probably have shrunk back irresolute, afraid of\\ntrusting to himself the direction of an enterprise on which so much\\ndepended.\\n\\nA modest man is steady, an humble man timid, and a vain one\\npresumptuous; this is the judgment, which the observation of many\\ncharacters, has led me to form.  Jesus Christ was modest, Moses was\\nhumble, and Peter vain.\\n\\nThus discriminating modesty from humility in one case, I do not\\nmean to confound it with bashfulness in the other.  Bashfulness, in\\nfact, is so distinct from modesty, that the most bashful lass, or\\nraw country lout, often becomes the most impudent; for their\\nbashfulness being merely the instinctive timidity of ignorance,\\ncustom soon changes it into assurance.*\\n\\n(*Footnote.  \"Such is the country-maiden\\'s fright,\\nWhen first a red-coat is in sight;\\nBehind the door she hides her face,\\nNext time at distance eyes the lace:\\nShe now can all his terrors stand,\\nNor from his squeeze withdraws her hand,\\nShe plays familiar in his arms,\\nAnd every soldier hath his charms;\\n>From tent to tent she spreads her flame;\\nFor custom conquers fear and shame.\")\\n\\nThe shameless behaviour of the prostitutes who infest the streets\\nof London, raising alternate emotions of pity and disgust, may\\nserve to illustrate this remark.  They trample on virgin\\nbashfulness with a sort of bravado, and glorying in their shame,\\nbecome more audaciously lewd than men, however depraved, to whom\\nthe sexual quality has not been gratuitously granted, ever appear\\nto be.  But these poor ignorant wretches never had any modesty to\\nlose, when they consigned themselves to infamy; for modesty is a\\nvirtue not a quality.  No, they were only bashful, shame-faced\\ninnocents; and losing their innocence, their shame-facedness was\\nrudely brushed off; a virtue would have left some vestiges in the\\nmind, had it been sacrificed to passion, to make us respect the\\ngrand ruin.\\n\\nPurity of mind, or that genuine delicacy, which is the only\\nvirtuous support of chastity, is near a-kin to that refinement of\\nhumanity, which never resides in any but cultivated minds.  It is\\nsomething nobler than innocence; it is the delicacy of reflection,\\nand not the coyness of ignorance.  The reserve of reason, which\\nlike habitual cleanliness, is seldom seen in any great degree,\\nunless the soul is active, may easily be distinguished from rustic\\nshyness or wanton skittishness; and so far from being incompatible\\nwith knowledge, it is its fairest fruit.  What a gross idea of\\nmodesty had the writer of the following remark!  \"The lady who\\nasked the question whether women may be instructed in the modern\\nsystem of botany, consistently with female delicacy?\" was accused\\nof ridiculous prudery:  nevertheless, if she had proposed the\\nquestion to me, I should certainly have answered--They cannot.\"\\nThus is the fair book of knowledge to be shut with an everlasting\\nseal!  On reading similar passages I have reverentially lifted up\\nmy eyes and heart to Him who liveth for ever and ever, and said, O\\nmy Father, hast Thou by the very constitution of her nature forbid\\nThy child to seek Thee in the fair forms of truth?  And, can her\\nsoul be sullied by the knowledge that awfully calls her to Thee?\\n\\nI have then philosophically pursued these reflections till I\\ninferred, that those women who have most improved their reason must\\nhave the most modesty --though a dignified sedateness of deportment\\nmay have succeeded the playful, bewitching bashfulness of youth.*\\n\\n(*Footnote.  Modesty, is the graceful calm virtue of maturity;\\nbashfulness, the charm of vivacious youth.)\\n\\nAnd thus have I argued.  To render chastity the virtue from which\\nunsophisticated modesty will naturally flow, the attention should\\nbe called away from employments, which only exercise the\\nsensibility; and the heart made to beat time to humanity, rather\\nthan to throb with love.  The woman who has dedicated a\\nconsiderable portion of her time to pursuits purely intellectual,\\nand whose affections have been exercised by humane plans of\\nusefulness, must have more purity of mind, as a natural\\nconsequence, than the ignorant beings whose time and thoughts have\\nbeen occupied by gay pleasures or schemes to conquer hearts.  The\\nregulation of the behaviour is not modesty, though those who study\\nrules of decorum, are, in general termed modest women.  Make the\\nheart clean, let it expand and feel for all that is human, instead\\nof being narrowed by selfish passions; and let the mind frequently\\ncontemplate subjects that exercise the understanding, without\\nheating the imagination, and artless modesty will give the\\nfinishing touches to the picture.\\n\\nShe who can discern the dawn of immortality, in the streaks that\\nshoot athwart the misty night of ignorance, promising a clearer\\nday, will respect, as a sacred temple, the body that enshrines such\\nan improvable soul.  True love, likewise, spreads this kind of\\nmysterious sanctity round the beloved object, making the lover most\\nmodest when in her presence.  So reserved is affection, that,\\nreceiving or returning personal endearments, it wishes, not only to\\nshun the human eye, as a kind of profanation; but to diffuse an\\nencircling cloudy obscurity to shut out even the saucy sparkling\\nsunbeams.  Yet, that affection does not deserve the epithet of\\nchaste which does not receive a sublime gloom of tender melancholy,\\nthat allows the mind for a moment to stand still and enjoy the\\npresent satisfaction, when a consciousness of the Divine presence\\nis felt--for this must ever be the food of joy!\\n\\nAs I have always been fond of tracing to its source in nature any\\nprevailing custom, I have frequently thought that it was a\\nsentiment of affection for whatever had touched the person of an\\nabsent or lost friend, which gave birth to that respect for relics,\\nso much abused by selfish priests.  Devotion, or love, may be\\nallowed to hallow the garments as well as the person; for the lover\\nmust want fancy, who has not a sort of sacred respect for the glove\\nor slipper of his mistress.  He could not confound them with vulgar\\nthings of the same kind.\\n\\nThis fine sentiment, perhaps, would not bear to be analyzed by the\\nexperimental philosopher--but of such stuff is human rapture made\\nup!-- A shadowy phantom glides before us, obscuring every other\\nobject; yet when the soft cloud is grasped, the form melts into\\ncommon air, leaving a solitary void, or sweet perfume, stolen from\\nthe violet, that memory long holds dear.  But, I have tripped\\nunawares on fairy ground, feeling the balmy gale of spring stealing\\non me, though November frowns.\\n\\nAs a sex, women are more chaste than men, and as modesty is the\\neffect of chastity, they may deserve to have this virtue ascribed\\nto them in rather an appropriated sense; yet, I must be allowed to\\nadd an hesitating if:-- for I doubt, whether chastity will produce\\nmodesty, though it may propriety of conduct, when it is merely a\\nrespect for the opinion of the world, and when coquetry and the\\nlovelorn tales of novelists employ the thoughts.  Nay, from\\nexperience, and reason, I should be lead to expect to meet with\\nmore modesty amongst men than women, simply because men exercise\\ntheir understandings more than women.\\n\\nBut, with respect to propriety of behaviour, excepting one class of\\nfemales, women have evidently the advantage.  What can be more\\ndisgusting than that impudent dross of gallantry, thought so manly,\\nwhich makes many men stare insultingly at every female they meet?\\nIs this respect for the sex?  This loose behaviour shows such\\nhabitual depravity, such weakness of mind, that it is vain to\\nexpect much public or private virtue, till both men and women grow\\nmore modest--till men, curbing a sensual fondness for the sex, or\\nan affectation of manly assurance, more properly speaking,\\nimpudence, treat each other with respect--unless appetite or\\npassion gives the tone, peculiar to it, to their behaviour.  I mean\\neven personal respect--the modest respect of humanity, and\\nfellow-feeling; not the libidinous mockery of gallantry, nor the\\ninsolent condescension of protectorship.\\n\\nTo carry the observation still further, modesty must heartily\\ndisclaim, and refuse to dwell with that debauchery of mind, which\\nleads a man coolly to bring forward, without a blush, indecent\\nallusions, or obscene witticisms, in the presence of a fellow\\ncreature; women are now out of the question, for then it is\\nbrutality.  Respect for man, as man is the foundation of every\\nnoble sentiment.  How much more modest is the libertine who obeys\\nthe call of appetite or fancy, than the lewd joker who sets the\\ntable in a roar.\\n\\nThis is one of the many instances in which the sexual distinction\\nrespecting modesty has proved fatal to virtue and happiness.  It\\nis, however, carried still further, and woman, weak woman! made by\\nher education the slave of sensibility, is required, on the most\\ntrying occasions, to resist that sensibility.  \"Can any thing,\"\\nsays Knox, be more absurd than keeping women in a state of\\nignorance, and yet so vehemently to insist on their resisting\\ntemptation?  Thus when virtue or honour make it proper to check a\\npassion, the burden is thrown on the weaker shoulders, contrary to\\nreason and true modesty, which, at least, should render the\\nself-denial mutual, to say nothing of the generosity of bravery,\\nsupposed to be a manly virtue.\\n\\nIn the same strain runs Rousseau\\'s and Dr. Gregory\\'s advice\\nrespecting modesty, strangely miscalled! for they both desire a\\nwife to leave it in doubt, whether sensibility or weakness led her\\nto her husband\\'s arms.  The woman is immodest who can let the\\nshadow of such a doubt remain on her husband\\'s mind a moment.\\n\\nBut to state the subject in a different light.  The want of\\nmodesty, which I principally deplore as subversive of morality,\\narises from the state of warfare so strenuously supported by\\nvoluptuous men as the very essence of modesty, though, in fact, its\\nbane; because it is a refinement on sensual desire, that men fall\\ninto who have not sufficient virtue to relish the innocent\\npleasures of love.  A man of delicacy carries his notions of\\nmodesty still further, for neither weakness nor sensibility will\\ngratify him--he looks for affection.\\n\\nAgain; men boast of their triumphs over women, what do they boast\\nof? Truly the creature of sensibility was surprised by her\\nsensibility into folly--into vice;* and the dreadful reckoning\\nfalls heavily on her own weak head, when reason wakes.  For where\\nart thou to find comfort, forlorn and disconsolate one?  He who\\nought to have directed thy reason, and supported thy weakness, has\\nbetrayed thee!  In a dream of passion thou consentedst to wander\\nthrough flowery lawns, and heedlessly stepping over the precipice\\nto which thy guide, instead of guarding, lured thee, thou startest\\nfrom thy dream only to face a sneering, frowning world, and to find\\nthyself alone in a waste, for he that triumphed in thy weakness is\\nnow pursuing new conquests; but for thee--there is no redemption on\\nthis side the grave!  And what resource hast thou in an enervated\\nmind to raise a sinking heart?\\n\\n(*Footnote.  The poor moth fluttering round a candle, burns its\\nwings.)\\n\\nBut, if the sexes be really to live in a state of warfare, if\\nnature has pointed it out, let men act nobly, or let pride whisper\\nto them, that the victory is mean when they merely vanquish\\nsensibility.  The real conquest is that over affection not taken by\\nsurprise--when, like Heloisa, a woman gives up all the world,\\ndeliberately, for love.  I do not now consider the wisdom or virtue\\nof such a sacrifice, I only contend that it was a sacrifice to\\naffection, and not merely to sensibility, though she had her share.\\nAnd I must be allowed to call her a modest woman, before I dismiss\\nthis part of the subject, by saying, that till men are more chaste,\\nwomen will be immodest.  Where, indeed, could modest women find\\nhusbands from whom they would not continually turn with disgust?\\nModesty must be equally cultivated by both sexes, or it will ever\\nremain a sickly hot-house plant, whilst the affectation of it, the\\nfig leaf borrowed by wantonness, may give a zest to voluptuous\\nenjoyments.)\\n\\nMen will probably still insist that woman ought to have more\\nmodesty than man; but it is not dispassionate reasoners who will\\nmost earnestly oppose my opinion.  No, they are the men of fancy,\\nthe favourites of the sex, who outwardly respect, and inwardly\\ndespise the weak creatures whom they thus sport with.  They cannot\\nsubmit to resign the highest sensual gratification, nor even to\\nrelish the epicurism of virtue--self-denial.\\n\\nTo take another view of the subject, confining my remarks to women.\\n\\nThe ridiculous falsities which are told to children, from mistaken\\nnotions of modesty, tend very early to inflame their imaginations\\nand set their little minds to work, respecting subjects, which\\nnature never intended they should think of, till the body arrived\\nat some degree of maturity; then the passions naturally begin to\\ntake place of the senses, as instruments to unfold the\\nunderstanding, and form the moral character.\\n\\nIn nurseries, and boarding schools, I fear, girls are first\\nspoiled; particularly in the latter.  A number of girls sleep in\\nthe same room, and wash together.  And, though I should be sorry to\\ncontaminate an innocent creature\\'s mind by instilling false\\ndelicacy, or those indecent prudish notions, which early cautions\\nrespecting the other sex naturally engender, I should be very\\nanxious to prevent their acquiring indelicate, or immodest habits;\\nand as many girls have learned very indelicate tricks, from\\nignorant servants, the mixing them thus indiscriminately together,\\nis very improper.\\n\\nTo say the truth, women are, in general, too familiar with each\\nother, which leads to that gross degree of familiarity that so\\nfrequently renders the marriage state unhappy.  Why in the name of\\ndecency are sisters, female intimates, or ladies and their waiting\\nwomen, to be so grossly familiar as to forget the respect which one\\nhuman creature owes to another?  That squeamish delicacy which\\nshrinks from the most disgusting offices when affection or humanity\\nlead us to watch at a sick pillow, is despicable.  But, why women\\nin health should be more familiar with each other than men are,\\nwhen they boast of their superiour delicacy, is a solecism in\\nmanners which I could never solve.\\n\\nIn order to preserve health and beauty, I should earnestly\\nrecommend frequent ablutions, to dignify my advice that it may not\\noffend the fastidious ear; and, by example, girls ought to be\\ntaught to wash and dress alone, without any distinction of rank;\\nand if custom should make them require some little assistance, let\\nthem not require it till that part of the business is over which\\nought never to be done before a fellow-creature; because it is an\\ninsult to the majesty of human nature.  Not on the score of\\nmodesty, but decency; for the care which some modest women take,\\nmaking at the same time a display of that care, not to let their\\nlegs be seen, is as childish as immodest.*\\n\\n(*Footnote.  I remember to have met with a sentence, in a book of\\neducation that made me smile.  \"It would be needless to caution you\\nagainst putting your hand, by chance, under your neck-handkerchief;\\nfor a modest woman never did so!\")\\n\\nI could proceed still further, till I animadverted on some still\\nmore indelicate customs, which men never fall into.  Secrets are\\ntold--where silence ought to reign; and that regard to cleanliness,\\nwhich some religious sects have, perhaps, carried too far,\\nespecially the Essenes, amongst the Jews, by making that an insult\\nto God which is only an insult to humanity, is violated in a brutal\\nmanner.  How can DELICATE women obtrude on notice that part of the\\nanimal economy, which is so very disgusting?  And is it not very\\nrational to conclude, that the women who have not been taught to\\nrespect the human nature of their own sex, in these particulars,\\nwill not long respect the mere difference of sex, in their\\nhusbands?  After their maidenish bashfulness is once lost, I, in\\nfact, have generally observed, that women fall into old habits; and\\ntreat their husbands as they did their sisters or female\\nacquaintance.\\n\\nBesides, women from necessity, because their minds are not\\ncultivated, have recourse very often, to what I familiarly term\\nbodily wit; and their intimacies are of the same kind.  In short,\\nwith respect to both mind and body, they are too intimate.  That\\ndecent personal reserve, which is the foundation of dignity of\\ncharacter, must be kept up between women, or their minds will never\\ngain strength or modesty.\\n\\nOn this account also, I object to many females being shut up\\ntogether in nurseries, schools, or convents.  I cannot recollect\\nwithout indignation, the jokes and hoiden tricks, which knots of\\nyoung women indulged themselves in, when in my youth accident threw\\nme, an awkward rustic, in their way.  They were almost on a par\\nwith the double meanings, which shake the convivial table when the\\nglass has circulated freely.  But it is vain to attempt to keep the\\nheart pure, unless the head is furnished with ideas, and set to\\nwork to compare them, in order, to acquire judgment, by\\ngeneralizing simple ones; and modesty by making the understanding\\ndamp the sensibility.\\n\\nIt may be thought that I lay too great a stress on personal\\nreserve; but it is ever the hand-maid of modesty.  So that were I\\nto name the graces that ought to adorn beauty, I should instantly\\nexclaim, cleanliness, neatness, and personal reserve.  It is\\nobvious, I suppose, that the reserve I mean, has nothing sexual in\\nit, and that I think it EQUALLY necessary in both sexes.  So\\nnecessary indeed, is that reserve and cleanliness which indolent\\nwomen too often neglect, that I will venture to affirm, that when\\ntwo or three women live in the same house, the one will be most\\nrespected by the male part of the family, who reside with them,\\nleaving love entirely out of the question, who pays this kind of\\nhabitual respect to her person.\\n\\nWhen domestic friends meet in a morning, there will naturally\\nprevail an affectionate seriousness, especially, if each look\\nforward to the discharge of daily duties; and it may be reckoned\\nfanciful, but this sentiment has frequently risen spontaneously in\\nmy mind.  I have been pleased after breathing the sweet bracing\\nmorning air, to see the same kind of freshness in the countenances\\nI particularly loved; I was glad to see them braced, as it were,\\nfor the day, and ready to run their course with the sun.  The\\ngreetings of affection in the morning are by these means more\\nrespectful, than the familiar tenderness which frequently prolongs\\nthe evening talk.  Nay, I have often felt hurt, not to say\\ndisgusted, when a friend has appeared, whom I parted with full\\ndressed the evening before, with her clothes huddled on, because\\nshe chose to indulge herself in bed till the last moment.\\n\\nDomestic affection can only be kept alive by these neglected\\nattentions; yet if men and women took half as much pains to dress\\nhabitually neat, as they do to ornament, or rather to disfigure\\ntheir persons, much would be done towards the attainment of purity\\nof mind.  But women only dress to gratify men of gallantry; for the\\nlover is always best pleased with the simple garb that sits close\\nto the shape.  There is an impertinence in ornaments that rebuffs\\naffection; because love always clings round the idea of home.\\n\\nAs a sex, women are habitually indolent; and every thing tends to\\nmake them so.  I do not forget the starts of activity which\\nsensibility produces; but as these flights of feeling only increase\\nthe evil, they are not to be confounded with the slow, orderly walk\\nof reason.  So great, in reality, is their mental and bodily\\nindolence, that till their body be strengthened and their\\nunderstanding enlarged by active exertions, there is little reason\\nto expect that modesty will take place of bashfulness.  They may\\nfind it prudent to assume its semblance; but the fair veil will\\nonly be worn on gala days.\\n\\nPerhaps there is not a virtue that mixes so kindly with every other\\nas modesty.  It is the pale moon-beam that renders more interesting\\nevery virtue it softens, giving mild grandeur to the contracted\\nhorizon.  Nothing can be more beautiful than the poetical fiction,\\nwhich makes Diana with her silver crescent, the goddess of\\nchastity.  I have sometimes thought, that wandering with sedate\\nstep in some lonely recess, a modest dame of antiquity must have\\nfelt a glow of conscious dignity, when, after contemplating the\\nsoft shadowy landscape, she has invited with placid fervour the\\nmild reflection of her sister\\'s beams to turn to her chaste bosom.\\n\\nA Christian has still nobler motives to incite her to preserve her\\nchastity and acquire modesty, for her body has been called the\\nTemple of the living God; of that God who requires more than\\nmodesty of mien.  His eye searcheth the heart; and let her\\nremember, that if she hopeth to find favour in the sight of purity\\nitself, her chastity must be founded on modesty, and not on worldly\\nprudence; or verily a good reputation will be her only reward; for\\nthat awful intercourse, that sacred communion, which virtue\\nestablishes between man and his Maker, must give rise to the wish\\nof being pure as he is pure!\\n\\nAfter the foregoing remarks, it is almost superfluous to add, that\\nI consider all those feminine airs of maturity, which succeed\\nbashfulness, to which truth is sacrificed, to secure the heart of a\\nhusband, or rather to force him to be still a lover when nature\\nwould, had she not been interrupted in her operations, have made\\nlove give place to friendship, as immodest.  The tenderness which a\\nman will feel for the mother of his children is an excellent\\nsubstitute for the ardour of unsatisfied passion; but to prolong\\nthat ardour it is indelicate, not to say immodest, for women to\\nfeign an unnatural coldness of constitution.  Women as well as men\\nought to have the common appetites and passions of their nature,\\nthey are only brutal when unchecked by reason:  but the obligation\\nto check them is the duty of mankind, not a sexual duty.  Nature,\\nin these respects, may safely be left to herself; let women only\\nacquire knowledge and humanity, and love will teach them modesty.\\nThere is no need of falsehoods, disgusting as futile, for studied\\nrules of behaviour only impose on shallow observers; a man of sense\\nsoon sees through, and despises the affectation.\\n\\nThe behaviour of young people, to each other, as men and women, is\\nthe last thing that should be thought of in education.  In fact,\\nbehaviour in most circumstances is now so much thought of, that\\nsimplicity of character is rarely to be seen;  yet, if men were\\nonly anxious to cultivate each virtue, and let it take root firmly\\nin the mind, the grace resulting from it, its natural exteriour\\nmark, would soon strip affectation of its flaunting plumes;\\nbecause, fallacious as unstable, is the conduct that is not founded\\nupon truth!\\n\\n(Footnote.  The behaviour of many newly married women has often\\ndisgusted me.  They seem anxious never to let their husbands forget\\nthe privilege of marriage, and to find no pleasure in his society\\nunless he is acting the lover.  Short, indeed, must be the reign of\\nlove, when the flame is thus constantly blown up, without its\\nreceiving any solid fuel.)\\n\\nWould ye, O my sisters, really possess modesty, ye must remember\\nthat the possession of virtue, of any denomination, is incompatible\\nwith ignorance and vanity! ye must acquire that soberness of mind,\\nwhich the exercise of duties, and the pursuit of knowledge, alone\\ninspire, or ye will still remain in a doubtful dependent situation,\\nand only be loved whilst ye are fair! the downcast eye, the rosy\\nblush, the retiring grace, are all proper in their season; but\\nmodesty, being the child of reason, cannot long exist with the\\nsensibility that is not tempered by reflection.  Besides, when\\nlove, even innocent love, is the whole employ of your lives, your\\nhearts will be too soft to afford modesty that tranquil retreat,\\nwhere she delights to dwell, in close union with humanity.\\n\\n',\n",

But on Sunday after luncheon he borrowed a cutter, and drove\\nover to Skuytercliff.\\n\\nPeople had always been told that the house at Skuytercliff was an\\nItalian villa.  Those who had never been to Italy believed it; so did\\nsome who had.  The house had been built by Mr. van der Luyden in his\\nyouth, on his return from the \"grand tour,\" and in anticipation of his\\napproaching marriage with Miss Louisa Dagonet.  It was a large square\\nwooden structure, with tongued and grooved walls painted pale green and\\nwhite, a Corinthian portico, and fluted pilasters between the windows.\\nFrom the high ground on which it stood a series of terraces bordered by\\nbalustrades and urns descended in the steel-engraving style to a small\\nirregular lake with an asphalt edge overhung by rare weeping conifers.\\nTo the right and left, the famous weedless lawns studded with\\n\"specimen\" trees (each of a different variety) rolled away to long\\nranges of grass crested with elaborate cast-iron ornaments; and below,\\nin a hollow, lay the four-roomed stone house which the first Patroon\\nhad built on the land granted him in 1612.\\n\\nAgainst the uniform sheet of snow and the greyish winter sky the\\nItalian villa loomed up rather grimly; even in summer it kept its\\ndistance, and the boldest coleus bed had never ventured nearer than\\nthirty feet from its awful front.  Now, as Archer rang the bell, the\\nlong tinkle seemed to echo through a mausoleum; and the surprise of the\\nbutler who at length responded to the call was as great as though he\\nhad been summoned from his final sleep.\\n\\nHappily Archer was of the family, and therefore, irregular though his\\narrival was, entitled to be informed that the Countess Olenska was out,\\nhaving driven to afternoon service with Mrs. van der Luyden exactly\\nthree quarters of an hour earlier.\\n\\n\"Mr. van der Luyden,\" the butler continued, \"is in, sir; but my\\nimpression is that he is either finishing his nap or else reading\\nyesterday\\'s Evening Post.  I heard him say, sir, on his return from\\nchurch this morning, that he intended to look through the Evening Post\\nafter luncheon; if you like, sir, I might go to the library door and\\nlisten--\"\\n\\nBut Archer, thanking him, said that he would go and meet the ladies;\\nand the butler, obviously relieved, closed the door on him majestically.\\n\\nA groom took the cutter to the stables, and Archer struck through the\\npark to the high-road.  The village of Skuytercliff was only a mile and\\na half away, but he knew that Mrs. van der Luyden never walked, and\\nthat he must keep to the road to meet the carriage.  Presently,\\nhowever, coming down a foot-path that crossed the highway, he caught\\nsight of a slight figure in a red cloak, with a big dog running ahead.\\nHe hurried forward, and Madame Olenska stopped short with a smile of\\nwelcome.\\n\\n\"Ah, you\\'ve come!\" she said, and drew her hand from her muff.\\n\\nThe red cloak made her look gay and vivid, like the Ellen Mingott of\\nold days; and he laughed as he took her hand, and answered:  \"I came to\\nsee what you were running away from.\"\\n\\nHer face clouded over, but she answered:  \"Ah, well--you will see,\\npresently.\"\\n\\nThe answer puzzled him.  \"Why--do you mean that you\\'ve been overtaken?\"\\n\\nShe shrugged her shoulders, with a little movement like Nastasia\\'s, and\\nrejoined in a lighter tone:  \"Shall we walk on?  I\\'m so cold after the\\nsermon.  And what does it matter, now you\\'re here to protect me?\"\\n\\nThe blood rose to his temples and he caught a fold of her cloak.\\n\"Ellen--what is it?  You must tell me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, presently--let\\'s run a race first: my feet are freezing to the\\nground,\" she cried; and gathering up the cloak she fled away across the\\nsnow, the dog leaping about her with challenging barks.  For a moment\\nArcher stood watching, his gaze delighted by the flash of the red\\nmeteor against the snow; then he started after her, and they met,\\npanting and laughing, at a wicket that led into the park.\\n\\nShe looked up at him and smiled.  \"I knew you\\'d come!\"\\n\\n\"That shows you wanted me to,\" he returned, with a disproportionate joy\\nin their nonsense.  The white glitter of the trees filled the air with\\nits own mysterious brightness, and as they walked on over the snow the\\nground seemed to sing under their feet.\\n\\n\"Where did you come from?\" Madame Olenska asked.\\n\\nHe told her, and added:  \"It was because I got your note.\"\\n\\nAfter a pause she said, with a just perceptible chill in her voice:\\n\"May asked you to take care of me.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t need any asking.\"\\n\\n\"You mean--I\\'m so evidently helpless and defenceless?  What a poor\\nthing you must all think me!  But women here seem not--seem never to\\nfeel the need: any more than the blessed in heaven.\"\\n\\nHe lowered his voice to ask:  \"What sort of a need?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, don\\'t ask me!  I don\\'t speak your language,\" she retorted\\npetulantly.\\n\\nThe answer smote him like a blow, and he stood still in the path,\\nlooking down at her.\\n\\n\"What did I come for, if I don\\'t speak yours?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, my friend--!\"  She laid her hand lightly on his arm, and he\\npleaded earnestly:  \"Ellen--why won\\'t you tell me what\\'s happened?\"\\n\\nShe shrugged again.  \"Does anything ever happen in heaven?\"\\n\\nHe was silent, and they walked on a few yards without exchanging a\\nword.  Finally she said:  \"I will tell you--but where, where, where?\\nOne can\\'t be alone for a minute in that great seminary of a house, with\\nall the doors wide open, and always a servant bringing tea, or a log\\nfor the fire, or the newspaper!  Is there nowhere in an American house\\nwhere one may be by one\\'s self?  You\\'re so shy, and yet you\\'re so\\npublic.  I always feel as if I were in the convent again--or on the\\nstage, before a dreadfully polite audience that never applauds.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, you don\\'t like us!\" Archer exclaimed.\\n\\nThey were walking past the house of the old Patroon, with its squat\\nwalls and small square windows compactly grouped about a central\\nchimney.  The shutters stood wide, and through one of the newly-washed\\nwindows Archer caught the light of a fire.\\n\\n\"Why--the house is open!\" he said.\\n\\nShe stood still.  \"No; only for today, at least.  I wanted to see it,\\nand Mr. van der Luyden had the fire lit and the windows opened, so that\\nwe might stop there on the way back from church this morning.\"  She ran\\nup the steps and tried the door.  \"It\\'s still unlocked--what luck!\\nCome in and we can have a quiet talk.  Mrs. van der Luyden has driven\\nover to see her old aunts at Rhinebeck and we shan\\'t be missed at the\\nhouse for another hour.\"\\n\\nHe followed her into the narrow passage.  His spirits, which had\\ndropped at her last words, rose with an irrational leap.  The homely\\nlittle house stood there, its panels and brasses shining in the\\nfirelight, as if magically created to receive them.  A big bed of\\nembers still gleamed in the kitchen chimney, under an iron pot hung\\nfrom an ancient crane.  Rush-bottomed arm-chairs faced each other\\nacross the tiled hearth, and rows of Delft plates stood on shelves\\nagainst the walls.  Archer stooped over and threw a log upon the embers.\\n\\nMadame Olenska, dropping her cloak, sat down in one of the chairs.\\nArcher leaned against the chimney and looked at her.\\n\\n\"You\\'re laughing now; but when you wrote me you were unhappy,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Yes.\"  She paused.  \"But I can\\'t feel unhappy when you\\'re here.\"\\n\\n\"I sha\\'n\\'t be here long,\" he rejoined, his lips stiffening with the\\neffort to say just so much and no more.\\n\\n\"No; I know.  But I\\'m improvident: I live in the moment when I\\'m happy.\"\\n\\nThe words stole through him like a temptation, and to close his senses\\nto it he moved away from the hearth and stood gazing out at the black\\ntree-boles against the snow.  But it was as if she too had shifted her\\nplace, and he still saw her, between himself and the trees, drooping\\nover the fire with her indolent smile.  Archer\\'s heart was beating\\ninsubordinately.  What if it were from him that she had been running\\naway, and if she had waited to tell him so till they were here alone\\ntogether in this secret room?\\n\\n\"Ellen, if I\\'m really a help to you--if you really wanted me to\\ncome--tell me what\\'s wrong, tell me what it is you\\'re running away\\nfrom,\" he insisted.\\n\\nHe spoke without shifting his position, without even turning to look at\\nher: if the thing was to happen, it was to happen in this way, with the\\nwhole width of the room between them, and his eyes still fixed on the\\nouter snow.\\n\\nFor a long moment she was silent; and in that moment Archer imagined\\nher, almost heard her, stealing up behind him to throw her light arms\\nabout his neck.  While he waited, soul and body throbbing with the\\nmiracle to come, his eyes mechanically received the image of a\\nheavily-coated man with his fur collar turned up who was advancing\\nalong the path to the house.  The man was Julius Beaufort.\\n\\n\"Ah--!\" Archer cried, bursting into a laugh.\\n\\nMadame Olenska had sprung up and moved to his side, slipping her hand\\ninto his; but after a glance through the window her face paled and she\\nshrank back.\\n\\n\"So that was it?\" Archer said derisively.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know he was here,\" Madame Olenska murmured.  Her hand still\\nclung to Archer\\'s; but he drew away from her, and walking out into the\\npassage threw open the door of the house.\\n\\n\"Hallo, Beaufort--this way!  Madame Olenska was expecting you,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nDuring his journey back to New York the next morning, Archer relived\\nwith a fatiguing vividness his last moments at Skuytercliff.\\n\\nBeaufort, though clearly annoyed at finding him with Madame Olenska,\\nhad, as usual, carried off the situation high-handedly.  His way of\\nignoring people whose presence inconvenienced him actually gave them,\\nif they were sensitive to it, a feeling of invisibility, of\\nnonexistence.  Archer, as the three strolled back through the park, was\\naware of this odd sense of disembodiment; and humbling as it was to his\\nvanity it gave him the ghostly advantage of observing unobserved.\\n\\nBeaufort had entered the little house with his usual easy assurance;\\nbut he could not smile away the vertical line between his eyes.  It was\\nfairly clear that Madame Olenska had not known that he was coming,\\nthough her words to Archer had hinted at the possibility; at any rate,\\nshe had evidently not told him where she was going when she left New\\nYork, and her unexplained departure had exasperated him.  The\\nostensible reason of his appearance was the discovery, the very night\\nbefore, of a \"perfect little house,\" not in the market, which was\\nreally just the thing for her, but would be snapped up instantly if she\\ndidn\\'t take it; and he was loud in mock-reproaches for the dance she\\nhad led him in running away just as he had found it.\\n\\n\"If only this new dodge for talking along a wire had been a little bit\\nnearer perfection I might have told you all this from town, and been\\ntoasting my toes before the club fire at this minute, instead of\\ntramping after you through the snow,\" he grumbled, disguising a real\\nirritation under the pretence of it; and at this opening Madame Olenska\\ntwisted the talk away to the fantastic possibility that they might one\\nday actually converse with each other from street to street, or\\neven--incredible dream!--from one town to another.  This struck from\\nall three allusions to Edgar Poe and Jules Verne, and such platitudes\\nas naturally rise to the lips of the most intelligent when they are\\ntalking against time, and dealing with a new invention in which it\\nwould seem ingenuous to believe too soon; and the question of the\\ntelephone carried them safely back to the big house.\\n\\nMrs. van der Luyden had not yet returned; and Archer took his leave and\\nwalked off to fetch the cutter, while Beaufort followed the Countess\\nOlenska indoors.  It was probable that, little as the van der Luydens\\nencouraged unannounced visits, he could count on being asked to dine,\\nand sent back to the station to catch the nine o\\'clock train; but more\\nthan that he would certainly not get, for it would be inconceivable to\\nhis hosts that a gentleman travelling without luggage should wish to\\nspend the night, and distasteful to them to propose it to a person with\\nwhom they were on terms of such limited cordiality as Beaufort.\\n\\nBeaufort knew all this, and must have foreseen it; and his taking the\\nlong journey for so small a reward gave the measure of his impatience.\\nHe was undeniably in pursuit of the Countess Olenska; and Beaufort had\\nonly one object in view in his pursuit of pretty women.  His dull and\\nchildless home had long since palled on him; and in addition to more\\npermanent consolations he was always in quest of amorous adventures in\\nhis own set.  This was the man from whom Madame Olenska was avowedly\\nflying: the question was whether she had fled because his importunities\\ndispleased her, or because she did not wholly trust herself to resist\\nthem; unless, indeed, all her talk of flight had been a blind, and her\\ndeparture no more than a manoeuvre.\\n\\nArcher did not really believe this.  Little as he had actually seen of\\nMadame Olenska, he was beginning to think that he could read her face,\\nand if not her face, her voice; and both had betrayed annoyance, and\\neven dismay, at Beaufort\\'s sudden appearance.  But, after all, if this\\nwere the case, was it not worse than if she had left New York for the\\nexpress purpose of meeting him?  If she had done that, she ceased to be\\nan object of interest, she threw in her lot with the vulgarest of\\ndissemblers: a woman engaged in a love affair with Beaufort \"classed\"\\nherself irretrievably.\\n\\nNo, it was worse a thousand times if, judging Beaufort, and probably\\ndespising him, she was yet drawn to him by all that gave him an\\nadvantage over the other men about her: his habit of two continents and\\ntwo societies, his familiar association with artists and actors and\\npeople generally in the world\\'s eye, and his careless contempt for\\nlocal prejudices.  Beaufort was vulgar, he was uneducated, he was\\npurse-proud; but the circumstances of his life, and a certain native\\nshrewdness, made him better worth talking to than many men, morally and\\nsocially his betters, whose horizon was bounded by the Battery and the\\nCentral Park.  How should any one coming from a wider world not feel\\nthe difference and be attracted by it?\\n\\nMadame Olenska, in a burst of irritation, had said to Archer that he\\nand she did not talk the same language; and the young man knew that in\\nsome respects this was true.  But Beaufort understood every turn of her\\ndialect, and spoke it fluently: his view of life, his tone, his\\nattitude, were merely a coarser reflection of those revealed in Count\\nOlenski\\'s letter.  This might seem to be to his disadvantage with Count\\nOlenski\\'s wife; but Archer was too intelligent to think that a young\\nwoman like Ellen Olenska would necessarily recoil from everything that\\nreminded her of her past.  She might believe herself wholly in revolt\\nagainst it; but what had charmed her in it would still charm her, even\\nthough it were against her will.\\n\\nThus, with a painful impartiality, did the young man make out the case\\nfor Beaufort, and for Beaufort\\'s victim.  A longing to enlighten her\\nwas strong in him; and there were moments when he imagined that all she\\nasked was to be enlightened.\\n\\nThat evening he unpacked his books from London.  The box was full of\\nthings he had been waiting for impatiently; a new volume of Herbert\\nSpencer, another collection of the prolific Alphonse Daudet\\'s brilliant\\ntales, and a novel called \"Middlemarch,\" as to which there had lately\\nbeen interesting things said in the reviews.  He had declined three\\ndinner invitations in favour of this feast; but though he turned the\\npages with the sensuous joy of the book-lover, he did not know what he\\nwas reading, and one book after another dropped from his hand.\\nSuddenly, among them, he lit on a small volume of verse which he had\\nordered because the name had attracted him:  \"The House of Life.\"  He\\ntook it up, and found himself plunged in an atmosphere unlike any he\\nhad ever breathed in books; so warm, so rich, and yet so ineffably\\ntender, that it gave a new and haunting beauty to the most elementary\\nof human passions.  All through the night he pursued through those\\nenchanted pages the vision of a woman who had the face of Ellen\\nOlenska; but when he woke the next morning, and looked out at the\\nbrownstone houses across the street, and thought of his desk in Mr.\\nLetterblair\\'s office, and the family pew in Grace Church, his hour in\\nthe park of Skuytercliff became as far outside the pale of probability\\nas the visions of the night.\\n\\n\"Mercy, how pale you look, Newland!\" Janey commented over the\\ncoffee-cups at breakfast; and his mother added:  \"Newland, dear, I\\'ve\\nnoticed lately that you\\'ve been coughing; I do hope you\\'re not letting\\nyourself be overworked?\"  For it was the conviction of both ladies\\nthat, under the iron despotism of his senior partners, the young man\\'s\\nlife was spent in the most exhausting professional labours--and he had\\nnever thought it necessary to undeceive them.\\n\\nThe next two or three days dragged by heavily.  The taste of the usual\\nwas like cinders in his mouth, and there were moments when he felt as\\nif he were being buried alive under his future.  He heard nothing of\\nthe Countess Olenska, or of the perfect little house, and though he met\\nBeaufort at the club they merely nodded at each other across the\\nwhist-tables.  It was not till the fourth evening that he found a note\\nawaiting him on his return home.  \"Come late tomorrow: I must explain\\nto you.  Ellen.\"  These were the only words it contained.\\n\\nThe young man, who was dining out, thrust the note into his pocket,\\nsmiling a little at the Frenchness of the \"to you.\"  After dinner he\\nwent to a play; and it was not until his return home, after midnight,\\nthat he drew Madame Olenska\\'s missive out again and re-read it slowly a\\nnumber of times.  There were several ways of answering it, and he gave\\nconsiderable thought to each one during the watches of an agitated\\nnight.  That on which, when morning came, he finally decided was to\\npitch some clothes into a portmanteau and jump on board a boat that was\\nleaving that very afternoon for St. Augustine.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nOn a January evening of the early seventies, Christine Nilsson was\\nsinging in Faust at the Academy of Music in New York.\\n\\nThough there was already talk of the erection, in remote metropolitan\\ndistances \"above the Forties,\" of a new Opera House which should\\ncompete in costliness and splendour with those of the great European\\ncapitals, the world of fashion was still content to reassemble every\\nwinter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old Academy.\\nConservatives cherished it for being small and inconvenient, and thus\\nkeeping out the \"new people\" whom New York was beginning to dread and\\nyet be drawn to; and the sentimental clung to it for its historic\\nassociations, and the musical for its excellent acoustics, always so\\nproblematic a quality in halls built for the hearing of music.\\n\\nIt was Madame Nilsson\\'s first appearance that winter, and what the\\ndaily press had already learned to describe as \"an exceptionally\\nbrilliant audience\" had gathered to hear her, transported through the\\nslippery, snowy streets in private broughams, in the spacious family\\nlandau, or in the humbler but more convenient \"Brown coupe.\" To come to\\nthe Opera in a Brown coupe was almost as honourable a way of arriving\\nas in one\\'s own carriage; and departure by the same means had the\\nimmense advantage of enabling one (with a playful allusion to\\ndemocratic principles) to scramble into the first Brown conveyance in\\nthe line, instead of waiting till the cold-and-gin congested nose of\\none\\'s own coachman gleamed under the portico of the Academy.  It was\\none of the great livery-stableman\\'s most masterly intuitions to have\\ndiscovered that Americans want to get away from amusement even more\\nquickly than they want to get to it.\\n\\nWhen Newland Archer opened the door at the back of the club box the\\ncurtain had just gone up on the garden scene.  There was no reason why\\nthe young man should not have come earlier, for he had dined at seven,\\nalone with his mother and sister, and had lingered afterward over a\\ncigar in the Gothic library with glazed black-walnut bookcases and\\nfinial-topped chairs which was the only room in the house where Mrs.\\nArcher allowed smoking.  But, in the first place, New York was a\\nmetropolis, and perfectly aware that in metropolises it was \"not the\\nthing\" to arrive early at the opera; and what was or was not \"the\\nthing\" played a part as important in Newland Archer\\'s New York as the\\ninscrutable totem terrors that had ruled the destinies of his\\nforefathers thousands of years ago.\\n\\nThe second reason for his delay was a personal one.  He had dawdled\\nover his cigar because he was at heart a dilettante, and thinking over\\na pleasure to come often gave him a subtler satisfaction than its\\nrealisation.  This was especially the case when the pleasure was a\\ndelicate one, as his pleasures mostly were; and on this occasion the\\nmoment he looked forward to was so rare and exquisite in quality\\nthat--well, if he had timed his arrival in accord with the prima\\ndonna\\'s stage-manager he could not have entered the Academy at a more\\nsignificant moment than just as she was singing:  \"He loves me--he\\nloves me not--HE LOVES ME!--\" and sprinkling the falling daisy petals\\nwith notes as clear as dew.\\n\\nShe sang, of course, \"M\\'ama!\" and not \"he loves me,\" since an\\nunalterable and unquestioned law of the musical world required that the\\nGerman text of French operas sung by Swedish artists should be\\ntranslated into Italian for the clearer understanding of\\nEnglish-speaking audiences.  This seemed as natural to Newland Archer\\nas all the other conventions on which his life was moulded: such as the\\nduty of using two silver-backed brushes with his monogram in blue\\nenamel to part his hair, and of never appearing in society without a\\nflower (preferably a gardenia) in his buttonhole.\\n\\n\"M\\'ama ... non m\\'ama ...\" the prima donna sang, and \"M\\'ama!\", with a\\nfinal burst of love triumphant, as she pressed the dishevelled daisy to\\nher lips and lifted her large eyes to the sophisticated countenance of\\nthe little brown Faust-Capoul, who was vainly trying, in a tight purple\\nvelvet doublet and plumed cap, to look as pure and true as his artless\\nvictim.\\n\\nNewland Archer, leaning against the wall at the back of the club box,\\nturned his eyes from the stage and scanned the opposite side of the\\nhouse.  Directly facing him was the box of old Mrs. Manson Mingott,\\nwhose monstrous obesity had long since made it impossible for her to\\nattend the Opera, but who was always represented on fashionable nights\\nby some of the younger members of the family.  On this occasion, the\\nfront of the box was filled by her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Lovell\\nMingott, and her daughter, Mrs. Welland; and slightly withdrawn behind\\nthese brocaded matrons sat a young girl in white with eyes ecstatically\\nfixed on the stagelovers.  As Madame Nilsson\\'s \"M\\'ama!\" thrilled out\\nabove the silent house (the boxes always stopped talking during the\\nDaisy Song) a warm pink mounted to the girl\\'s cheek, mantled her brow\\nto the roots of her fair braids, and suffused the young slope of her\\nbreast to the line where it met a modest tulle tucker fastened with a\\nsingle gardenia.  She dropped her eyes to the immense bouquet of\\nlilies-of-the-valley on her knee, and Newland Archer saw her\\nwhite-gloved finger-tips touch the flowers softly.  He drew a breath of\\nsatisfied vanity and his eyes returned to the stage.\\n\\nNo expense had been spared on the setting, which was acknowledged to be\\nvery beautiful even by people who shared his acquaintance with the\\nOpera houses of Paris and Vienna.  The foreground, to the footlights,\\nwas covered with emerald green cloth.  In the middle distance\\nsymmetrical mounds of woolly green moss bounded by croquet hoops formed\\nthe base of shrubs shaped like orange-trees but studded with large pink\\nand red roses.  Gigantic pansies, considerably larger than the roses,\\nand closely resembling the floral pen-wipers made by female\\nparishioners for fashionable clergymen, sprang from the moss beneath\\nthe rose-trees; and here and there a daisy grafted on a rose-branch\\nflowered with a luxuriance prophetic of Mr. Luther Burbank\\'s far-off\\nprodigies.\\n\\nIn the centre of this enchanted garden Madame Nilsson, in white\\ncashmere slashed with pale blue satin, a reticule dangling from a blue\\ngirdle, and large yellow braids carefully disposed on each side of her\\nmuslin chemisette, listened with downcast eyes to M. Capoul\\'s\\nimpassioned wooing, and affected a guileless incomprehension of his\\ndesigns whenever, by word or glance, he persuasively indicated the\\nground floor window of the neat brick villa projecting obliquely from\\nthe right wing.\\n\\n\"The darling!\" thought Newland Archer, his glance flitting back to the\\nyoung girl with the lilies-of-the-valley.  \"She doesn\\'t even guess what\\nit\\'s all about.\" And he contemplated her absorbed young face with a\\nthrill of possessorship in which pride in his own masculine initiation\\nwas mingled with a tender reverence for her abysmal purity.  \"We\\'ll\\nread Faust together ... by the Italian lakes ...\" he thought, somewhat\\nhazily confusing the scene of his projected honey-moon with the\\nmasterpieces of literature which it would be his manly privilege to\\nreveal to his bride.  It was only that afternoon that May Welland had\\nlet him guess that she \"cared\" (New York\\'s consecrated phrase of maiden\\navowal), and already his imagination, leaping ahead of the engagement\\nring, the betrothal kiss and the march from Lohengrin, pictured her at\\nhis side in some scene of old European witchery.\\n\\nHe did not in the least wish the future Mrs. Newland Archer to be a\\nsimpleton.  He meant her (thanks to his enlightening companionship) to\\ndevelop a social tact and readiness of wit enabling her to hold her own\\nwith the most popular married women of the \"younger set,\" in which it\\nwas the recognised custom to attract masculine homage while playfully\\ndiscouraging it.  If he had probed to the bottom of his vanity (as he\\nsometimes nearly did) he would have found there the wish that his wife\\nshould be as worldly-wise and as eager to please as the married lady\\nwhose charms had held his fancy through two mildly agitated years;\\nwithout, of course, any hint of the frailty which had so nearly marred\\nthat unhappy being\\'s life, and had disarranged his own plans for a\\nwhole winter.\\n\\nHow this miracle of fire and ice was to be created, and to sustain\\nitself in a harsh world, he had never taken the time to think out; but\\nhe was content to hold his view without analysing it, since he knew it\\nwas that of all the carefully-brushed, white-waistcoated,\\nbutton-hole-flowered gentlemen who succeeded each other in the club\\nbox, exchanged friendly greetings with him, and turned their\\nopera-glasses critically on the circle of ladies who were the product\\nof the system.  In matters intellectual and artistic Newland Archer\\nfelt himself distinctly the superior of these chosen specimens of old\\nNew York gentility; he had probably read more, thought more, and even\\nseen a good deal more of the world, than any other man of the number.\\nSingly they betrayed their inferiority; but grouped together they\\nrepresented \"New York,\" and the habit of masculine solidarity made him\\naccept their doctrine on all the issues called moral.  He instinctively\\nfelt that in this respect it would be troublesome--and also rather bad\\nform--to strike out for himself.\\n\\n\"Well--upon my soul!\" exclaimed Lawrence Lefferts, turning his\\nopera-glass abruptly away from the stage.  Lawrence Lefferts was, on\\nthe whole, the foremost authority on \"form\" in New York.  He had\\nprobably devoted more time than any one else to the study of this\\nintricate and fascinating question; but study alone could not account\\nfor his complete and easy competence.  One had only to look at him,\\nfrom the slant of his bald forehead and the curve of his beautiful fair\\nmoustache to the long patent-leather feet at the other end of his lean\\nand elegant person, to feel that the knowledge of \"form\" must be\\ncongenital in any one who knew how to wear such good clothes so\\ncarelessly and carry such height with so much lounging grace.  As a\\nyoung admirer had once said of him:  \"If anybody can tell a fellow just\\nwhen to wear a black tie with evening clothes and when not to, it\\'s\\nLarry Lefferts.\"  And on the question of pumps versus patent-leather\\n\"Oxfords\" his authority had never been disputed.\\n\\n\"My God!\" he said; and silently handed his glass to old Sillerton\\nJackson.\\n\\nNewland Archer, following Lefferts\\'s glance, saw with surprise that his\\nexclamation had been occasioned by the entry of a new figure into old\\nMrs. Mingott\\'s box.  It was that of a slim young woman, a little less\\ntall than May Welland, with brown hair growing in close curls about her\\ntemples and held in place by a narrow band of diamonds.  The suggestion\\nof this headdress, which gave her what was then called a \"Josephine\\nlook,\" was carried out in the cut of the dark blue velvet gown rather\\ntheatrically caught up under her bosom by a girdle with a large\\nold-fashioned clasp.  The wearer of this unusual dress, who seemed\\nquite unconscious of the attention it was attracting, stood a moment in\\nthe centre of the box, discussing with Mrs. Welland the propriety of\\ntaking the latter\\'s place in the front right-hand corner; then she\\nyielded with a slight smile, and seated herself in line with Mrs.\\nWelland\\'s sister-in-law, Mrs. Lovell Mingott, who was installed in the\\nopposite corner.\\n\\nMr. Sillerton Jackson had returned the opera-glass to Lawrence\\nLefferts.  The whole of the club turned instinctively, waiting to hear\\nwhat the old man had to say; for old Mr. Jackson was as great an\\nauthority on \"family\" as Lawrence Lefferts was on \"form.\"  He knew all\\nthe ramifications of New York\\'s cousinships; and could not only\\nelucidate such complicated questions as that of the connection between\\nthe Mingotts (through the Thorleys) with the Dallases of South\\nCarolina, and that of the relationship of the elder branch of\\nPhiladelphia Thorleys to the Albany Chiverses (on no account to be\\nconfused with the Manson Chiverses of University Place), but could also\\nenumerate the leading characteristics of each family: as, for instance,\\nthe fabulous stinginess of the younger lines of Leffertses (the Long\\nIsland ones); or the fatal tendency of the Rushworths to make foolish\\nmatches; or the insanity recurring in every second generation of the\\nAlbany Chiverses, with whom their New York cousins had always refused\\nto intermarry--with the disastrous exception of poor Medora Manson,\\nwho, as everybody knew ... but then her mother was a Rushworth.\\n\\nIn addition to this forest of family trees, Mr. Sillerton Jackson\\ncarried between his narrow hollow temples, and under his soft thatch of\\nsilver hair, a register of most of the scandals and mysteries that had\\nsmouldered under the unruffled surface of New York society within the\\nlast fifty years.  So far indeed did his information extend, and so\\nacutely retentive was his memory, that he was supposed to be the only\\nman who could have told you who Julius Beaufort, the banker, really\\nwas, and what had become of handsome Bob Spicer, old Mrs. Manson\\nMingott\\'s father, who had disappeared so mysteriously (with a large sum\\nof trust money) less than a year after his marriage, on the very day\\nthat a beautiful Spanish dancer who had been delighting thronged\\naudiences in the old Opera-house on the Battery had taken ship for\\nCuba.  But these mysteries, and many others, were closely locked in Mr.\\nJackson\\'s breast; for not only did his keen sense of honour forbid his\\nrepeating anything privately imparted, but he was fully aware that his\\nreputation for discretion increased his opportunities of finding out\\nwhat he wanted to know.\\n\\nThe club box, therefore, waited in visible suspense while Mr. Sillerton\\nJackson handed back Lawrence Lefferts\\'s opera-glass.  For a moment he\\nsilently scrutinised the attentive group out of his filmy blue eyes\\noverhung by old veined lids; then he gave his moustache a thoughtful\\ntwist, and said simply:  \"I didn\\'t think the Mingotts would have tried\\nit on.\"\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nAs he came out into the lobby Archer ran across his friend Ned Winsett,\\nthe only one among what Janey called his \"clever people\" with whom he\\ncared to probe into things a little deeper than the average level of\\nclub and chop-house banter.\\n\\nHe had caught sight, across the house, of Winsett\\'s shabby\\nround-shouldered back, and had once noticed his eyes turned toward the\\nBeaufort box.  The two men shook hands, and Winsett proposed a bock at\\na little German restaurant around the corner.  Archer, who was not in\\nthe mood for the kind of talk they were likely to get there, declined\\non the plea that he had work to do at home; and Winsett said:  \"Oh,\\nwell so have I for that matter, and I\\'ll be the Industrious Apprentice\\ntoo.\"\\n\\nThey strolled along together, and presently Winsett said:  \"Look here,\\nwhat I\\'m really after is the name of the dark lady in that swell box of\\nyours--with the Beauforts, wasn\\'t she?  The one your friend Lefferts\\nseems so smitten by.\"\\n\\nArcher, he could not have said why, was slightly annoyed.  What the\\ndevil did Ned Winsett want with Ellen Olenska\\'s name?  And above all,\\nwhy did he couple it with Lefferts\\'s?  It was unlike Winsett to\\nmanifest such curiosity; but after all, Archer remembered, he was a\\njournalist.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not for an interview, I hope?\" he laughed.\\n\\n\"Well--not for the press; just for myself,\" Winsett rejoined.  \"The\\nfact is she\\'s a neighbour of mine--queer quarter for such a beauty to\\nsettle in--and she\\'s been awfully kind to my little boy, who fell down\\nher area chasing his kitten, and gave himself a nasty cut.  She rushed\\nin bareheaded, carrying him in her arms, with his knee all beautifully\\nbandaged, and was so sympathetic and beautiful that my wife was too\\ndazzled to ask her name.\"\\n\\nA pleasant glow dilated Archer\\'s heart.  There was nothing\\nextraordinary in the tale: any woman would have done as much for a\\nneighbour\\'s child.  But it was just like Ellen, he felt, to have rushed\\nin bareheaded, carrying the boy in her arms, and to have dazzled poor\\nMrs. Winsett into forgetting to ask who she was.\\n\\n\"That is the Countess Olenska--a granddaughter of old Mrs. Mingott\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Whew--a Countess!\" whistled Ned Winsett.  \"Well, I didn\\'t know\\nCountesses were so neighbourly.  Mingotts ain\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"They would be, if you\\'d let them.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, well--\"  It was their old interminable argument as to the\\nobstinate unwillingness of the \"clever people\" to frequent the\\nfashionable, and both men knew that there was no use in prolonging it.\\n\\n\"I wonder,\" Winsett broke off, \"how a Countess happens to live in our\\nslum?\"\\n\\n\"Because she doesn\\'t care a hang about where she lives--or about any of\\nour little social sign-posts,\" said Archer, with a secret pride in his\\nown picture of her.\\n\\n\"H\\'m--been in bigger places, I suppose,\" the other commented.  \"Well,\\nhere\\'s my corner.\"\\n\\nHe slouched off across Broadway, and Archer stood looking after him and\\nmusing on his last words.\\n\\nNed Winsett had those flashes of penetration; they were the most\\ninteresting thing about him, and always made Archer wonder why they had\\nallowed him to accept failure so stolidly at an age when most men are\\nstill struggling.\\n\\nArcher had known that Winsett had a wife and child, but he had never\\nseen them.  The two men always met at the Century, or at some haunt of\\njournalists and theatrical people, such as the restaurant where Winsett\\nhad proposed to go for a bock.  He had given Archer to understand that\\nhis wife was an invalid; which might be true of the poor lady, or might\\nmerely mean that she was lacking in social gifts or in evening clothes,\\nor in both.  Winsett himself had a savage abhorrence of social\\nobservances: Archer, who dressed in the evening because he thought it\\ncleaner and more comfortable to do so, and who had never stopped to\\nconsider that cleanliness and comfort are two of the costliest items in\\na modest budget, regarded Winsett\\'s attitude as part of the boring\\n\"Bohemian\" pose that always made fashionable people, who changed their\\nclothes without talking about it, and were not forever harping on the\\nnumber of servants one kept, seem so much simpler and less\\nself-conscious than the others.  Nevertheless, he was always stimulated\\nby Winsett, and whenever he caught sight of the journalist\\'s lean\\nbearded face and melancholy eyes he would rout him out of his corner\\nand carry him off for a long talk.\\n\\nWinsett was not a journalist by choice.  He was a pure man of letters,\\nuntimely born in a world that had no need of letters; but after\\npublishing one volume of brief and exquisite literary appreciations, of\\nwhich one hundred and twenty copies were sold, thirty given away, and\\nthe balance eventually destroyed by the publishers (as per contract) to\\nmake room for more marketable material, he had abandoned his real\\ncalling, and taken a sub-editorial job on a women\\'s weekly, where\\nfashion-plates and paper patterns alternated with New England\\nlove-stories and advertisements of temperance drinks.\\n\\nOn the subject of \"Hearth-fires\" (as the paper was called) he was\\ninexhaustibly entertaining; but beneath his fun lurked the sterile\\nbitterness of the still young man who has tried and given up.  His\\nconversation always made Archer take the measure of his own life, and\\nfeel how little it contained; but Winsett\\'s, after all, contained still\\nless, and though their common fund of intellectual interests and\\ncuriosities made their talks exhilarating, their exchange of views\\nusually remained within the limits of a pensive dilettantism.\\n\\n\"The fact is, life isn\\'t much a fit for either of us,\" Winsett had once\\nsaid.  \"I\\'m down and out; nothing to be done about it.  I\\'ve got only\\none ware to produce, and there\\'s no market for it here, and won\\'t be in\\nmy time.  But you\\'re free and you\\'re well-off.  Why don\\'t you get into\\ntouch?  There\\'s only one way to do it: to go into politics.\"\\n\\nArcher threw his head back and laughed.  There one saw at a flash the\\nunbridgeable difference between men like Winsett and the\\nothers--Archer\\'s kind.  Every one in polite circles knew that, in\\nAmerica, \"a gentleman couldn\\'t go into politics.\"  But, since he could\\nhardly put it in that way to Winsett, he answered evasively: \"Look at\\nthe career of the honest man in American politics!  They don\\'t want us.\"\\n\\n\"Who\\'s \\'they\\'?  Why don\\'t you all get together and be \\'they\\'\\nyourselves?\"\\n\\nArcher\\'s laugh lingered on his lips in a slightly condescending smile.\\nIt was useless to prolong the discussion: everybody knew the melancholy\\nfate of the few gentlemen who had risked their clean linen in municipal\\nor state politics in New York.  The day was past when that sort of\\nthing was possible: the country was in possession of the bosses and the\\nemigrant, and decent people had to fall back on sport or culture.\\n\\n\"Culture!  Yes--if we had it!  But there are just a few little local\\npatches, dying out here and there for lack of--well, hoeing and\\ncross-fertilising: the last remnants of the old European tradition that\\nyour forebears brought with them.  But you\\'re in a pitiful little\\nminority: you\\'ve got no centre, no competition, no audience.  You\\'re\\nlike the pictures on the walls of a deserted house:  \\'The Portrait of a\\nGentleman.\\'  You\\'ll never amount to anything, any of you, till you roll\\nup your sleeves and get right down into the muck.  That, or emigrate\\n... God!  If I could emigrate ...\"\\n\\nArcher mentally shrugged his shoulders and turned the conversation back\\nto books, where Winsett, if uncertain, was always interesting.\\nEmigrate!  As if a gentleman could abandon his own country!  One could\\nno more do that than one could roll up one\\'s sleeves and go down into\\nthe muck.  A gentleman simply stayed at home and abstained.  But you\\ncouldn\\'t make a man like Winsett see that; and that was why the New\\nYork of literary clubs and exotic restaurants, though a first shake\\nmade it seem more of a kaleidoscope, turned out, in the end, to be a\\nsmaller box, with a more monotonous pattern, than the assembled atoms\\nof Fifth Avenue.\\n\\n\\nThe next morning Archer scoured the town in vain for more yellow roses.\\nIn consequence of this search he arrived late at the office, perceived\\nthat his doing so made no difference whatever to any one, and was\\nfilled with sudden exasperation at the elaborate futility of his life.\\nWhy should he not be, at that moment, on the sands of St. Augustine\\nwith May Welland?  No one was deceived by his pretense of professional\\nactivity.  In old-fashioned legal firms like that of which Mr.\\nLetterblair was the head, and which were mainly engaged in the\\nmanagement of large estates and \"conservative\" investments, there were\\nalways two or three young men, fairly well-off, and without\\nprofessional ambition, who, for a certain number of hours of each day,\\nsat at their desks accomplishing trivial tasks, or simply reading the\\nnewspapers.  Though it was supposed to be proper for them to have an\\noccupation, the crude fact of money-making was still regarded as\\nderogatory, and the law, being a profession, was accounted a more\\ngentlemanly pursuit than business.  But none of these young men had\\nmuch hope of really advancing in his profession, or any earnest desire\\nto do so; and over many of them the green mould of the perfunctory was\\nalready perceptibly spreading.\\n\\nIt made Archer shiver to think that it might be spreading over him too.\\nHe had, to be sure, other tastes and interests; he spent his vacations\\nin European travel, cultivated the \"clever people\" May spoke of, and\\ngenerally tried to \"keep up,\" as he had somewhat wistfully put it to\\nMadame Olenska.  But once he was married, what would become of this\\nnarrow margin of life in which his real experiences were lived?  He had\\nseen enough of other young men who had dreamed his dream, though\\nperhaps less ardently, and who had gradually sunk into the placid and\\nluxurious routine of their elders.\\n\\nFrom the office he sent a note by messenger to Madame Olenska, asking\\nif he might call that afternoon, and begging her to let him find a\\nreply at his club; but at the club he found nothing, nor did he receive\\nany letter the following day.  This unexpected silence mortified him\\nbeyond reason, and though the next morning he saw a glorious cluster of\\nyellow roses behind a florist\\'s window-pane, he left it there.  It was\\nonly on the third morning that he received a line by post from the\\nCountess Olenska.  To his surprise it was dated from Skuytercliff,\\nwhither the van der Luydens had promptly retreated after putting the\\nDuke on board his steamer.\\n\\n\"I ran away,\" the writer began abruptly (without the usual\\npreliminaries), \"the day after I saw you at the play, and these kind\\nfriends have taken me in.  I wanted to be quiet, and think things over.\\nYou were right in telling me how kind they were; I feel myself so safe\\nhere.  I wish that you were with us.\"  She ended with a conventional\\n\"Yours sincerely,\" and without any allusion to the date of her return.\\n\\nThe tone of the note surprised the young man.  What was Madame Olenska\\nrunning away from, and why did she feel the need to be safe?  His first\\nthought was of some dark menace from abroad; then he reflected that he\\ndid not know her epistolary style, and that it might run to picturesque\\nexaggeration.  Women always exaggerated; and moreover she was not\\nwholly at her ease in English, which she often spoke as if she were\\ntranslating from the French.  \"Je me suis evadee--\" put in that way,\\nthe opening sentence immediately suggested that she might merely have\\nwanted to escape from a boring round of engagements; which was very\\nlikely true, for he judged her to be capricious, and easily wearied of\\nthe pleasure of the moment.\\n\\nIt amused him to think of the van der Luydens\\' having carried her off\\nto Skuytercliff on a second visit, and this time for an indefinite\\nperiod.  The doors of Skuytercliff were rarely and grudgingly opened to\\nvisitors, and a chilly week-end was the most ever offered to the few\\nthus privileged.  But Archer had seen, on his last visit to Paris, the\\ndelicious play of Labiche, \"Le Voyage de M. Perrichon,\" and he\\nremembered M.  Perrichon\\'s dogged and undiscouraged attachment to the\\nyoung man whom he had pulled out of the glacier.  The van der Luydens\\nhad rescued Madame Olenska from a doom almost as icy; and though there\\nwere many other reasons for being attracted to her, Archer knew that\\nbeneath them all lay the gentle and obstinate determination to go on\\nrescuing her.\\n\\nHe felt a distinct disappointment on learning that she was away; and\\nalmost immediately remembered that, only the day before, he had refused\\nan invitation to spend the following Sunday with the Reggie Chiverses\\nat their house on the Hudson, a few miles below Skuytercliff.\\n\\nHe had had his fill long ago of the noisy friendly parties at Highbank,\\nwith coasting, ice-boating, sleighing, long tramps in the snow, and a\\ngeneral flavour of mild flirting and milder practical jokes.  He had\\njust received a box of new books from his London book-seller, and had\\npreferred the prospect of a quiet Sunday at home with his spoils.  But\\nhe now went into the club writing-room, wrote a hurried telegram, and\\ntold the servant to send it immediately.

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nWhen Archer walked down the sandy main street of St. Augustine to the\\nhouse which had been pointed out to him as Mr. Welland\\'s, and saw May\\nWelland standing under a magnolia with the sun in her hair, he wondered\\nwhy he had waited so long to come.\\n\\nHere was the truth, here was reality, here was the life that belonged\\nto him; and he, who fancied himself so scornful of arbitrary\\nrestraints, had been afraid to break away from his desk because of what\\npeople might think of his stealing a holiday!\\n\\nHer first exclamation was:  \"Newland--has anything happened?\" and it\\noccurred to him that it would have been more \"feminine\" if she had\\ninstantly read in his eyes why he had come.  But when he answered:\\n\"Yes--I found I had to see you,\" her happy blushes took the chill from\\nher surprise, and he saw how easily he would be forgiven, and how soon\\neven Mr. Letterblair\\'s mild disapproval would be smiled away by a\\ntolerant family.\\n\\nEarly as it was, the main street was no place for any but formal\\ngreetings, and Archer longed to be alone with May, and to pour out all\\nhis tenderness and his impatience.  It still lacked an hour to the late\\nWelland breakfast-time, and instead of asking him to come in she\\nproposed that they should walk out to an old orange-garden beyond the\\ntown.  She had just been for a row on the river, and the sun that\\nnetted the little waves with gold seemed to have caught her in its\\nmeshes.  Across the warm brown of her cheek her blown hair glittered\\nlike silver wire; and her eyes too looked lighter, almost pale in their\\nyouthful limpidity.  As she walked beside Archer with her long swinging\\ngait her face wore the vacant serenity of a young marble athlete.\\n\\nTo Archer\\'s strained nerves the vision was as soothing as the sight of\\nthe blue sky and the lazy river.  They sat down on a bench under the\\norange-trees and he put his arm about her and kissed her.  It was like\\ndrinking at a cold spring with the sun on it; but his pressure may have\\nbeen more vehement than he had intended, for the blood rose to her face\\nand she drew back as if he had startled her.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" he asked, smiling; and she looked at him with surprise,\\nand answered:  \"Nothing.\"\\n\\nA slight embarrassment fell on them, and her hand slipped out of his.\\nIt was the only time that he had kissed her on the lips except for\\ntheir fugitive embrace in the Beaufort conservatory, and he saw that\\nshe was disturbed, and shaken out of her cool boyish composure.\\n\\n\"Tell me what you do all day,\" he said, crossing his arms under his\\ntilted-back head, and pushing his hat forward to screen the sun-dazzle.\\nTo let her talk about familiar and simple things was the easiest way of\\ncarrying on his own independent train of thought; and he sat listening\\nto her simple chronicle of swimming, sailing and riding, varied by an\\noccasional dance at the primitive inn when a man-of-war came in.  A few\\npleasant people from Philadelphia and Baltimore were picknicking at the\\ninn, and the Selfridge Merrys had come down for three weeks because\\nKate Merry had had bronchitis.  They were planning to lay out a lawn\\ntennis court on the sands; but no one but Kate and May had racquets,\\nand most of the people had not even heard of the game.\\n\\nAll this kept her very busy, and she had not had time to do more than\\nlook at the little vellum book that Archer had sent her the week before\\n(the \"Sonnets from the Portuguese\"); but she was learning by heart \"How\\nthey brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix,\" because it was one of\\nthe first things he had ever read to her; and it amused her to be able\\nto tell him that Kate Merry had never even heard of a poet called\\nRobert Browning.\\n\\nPresently she started up, exclaiming that they would be late for\\nbreakfast; and they hurried back to the tumble-down house with its\\npointless porch and unpruned hedge of plumbago and pink geraniums where\\nthe Wellands were installed for the winter.  Mr. Welland\\'s sensitive\\ndomesticity shrank from the discomforts of the slovenly southern hotel,\\nand at immense expense, and in face of almost insuperable difficulties,\\nMrs. Welland was obliged, year after year, to improvise an\\nestablishment partly made up of discontented New York servants and\\npartly drawn from the local African supply.\\n\\n\"The doctors want my husband to feel that he is in his own home;\\notherwise he would be so wretched that the climate would not do him any\\ngood,\" she explained, winter after winter, to the sympathising\\nPhiladelphians and Baltimoreans; and Mr. Welland, beaming across a\\nbreakfast table miraculously supplied with the most varied delicacies,\\nwas presently saying to Archer: \"You see, my dear fellow, we camp--we\\nliterally camp.  I tell my wife and May that I want to teach them how\\nto rough it.\"\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Welland had been as much surprised as their daughter by\\nthe young man\\'s sudden arrival; but it had occurred to him to explain\\nthat he had felt himself on the verge of a nasty cold, and this seemed\\nto Mr. Welland an all-sufficient reason for abandoning any duty.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t be too careful, especially toward spring,\" he said, heaping\\nhis plate with straw-coloured griddle-cakes and drowning them in golden\\nsyrup.  \"If I\\'d only been as prudent at your age May would have been\\ndancing at the Assemblies now, instead of spending her winters in a\\nwilderness with an old invalid.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, but I love it here, Papa; you know I do.  If only Newland could\\nstay I should like it a thousand times better than New York.\"\\n\\n\"Newland must stay till he has quite thrown off his cold,\" said Mrs.\\nWelland indulgently; and the young man laughed, and said he supposed\\nthere was such a thing as one\\'s profession.\\n\\nHe managed, however, after an exchange of telegrams with the firm, to\\nmake his cold last a week; and it shed an ironic light on the situation\\nto know that Mr. Letterblair\\'s indulgence was partly due to the\\nsatisfactory way in which his brilliant young junior partner had\\nsettled the troublesome matter of the Olenski divorce.  Mr. Letterblair\\nhad let Mrs. Welland know that Mr. Archer had \"rendered an invaluable\\nservice\" to the whole family, and that old Mrs. Manson Mingott had been\\nparticularly pleased; and one day when May had gone for a drive with\\nher father in the only vehicle the place produced Mrs. Welland took\\noccasion to touch on a topic which she always avoided in her daughter\\'s\\npresence.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid Ellen\\'s ideas are not at all like ours.  She was barely\\neighteen when Medora Manson took her back to Europe--you remember the\\nexcitement when she appeared in black at her coming-out ball?  Another\\nof Medora\\'s fads--really this time it was almost prophetic!  That must\\nhave been at least twelve years ago; and since then Ellen has never\\nbeen to America.  No wonder she is completely Europeanised.\"\\n\\n\"But European society is not given to divorce: Countess Olenska thought\\nshe would be conforming to American ideas in asking for her freedom.\"\\nIt was the first time that the young man had pronounced her name since\\nhe had left Skuytercliff, and he felt the colour rise to his cheek.\\n\\nMrs. Welland smiled compassionately.  \"That is just like the\\nextraordinary things that foreigners invent about us. They think we\\ndine at two o\\'clock and countenance divorce!  That is why it seems to\\nme so foolish to entertain them when they come to New York.  They\\naccept our hospitality, and then they go home and repeat the same\\nstupid stories.\"\\n\\nArcher made no comment on this, and Mrs. Welland continued:  \"But we do\\nmost thoroughly appreciate your persuading Ellen to give up the idea.\\nHer grandmother and her uncle Lovell could do nothing with her; both of\\nthem have written that her changing her mind was entirely due to your\\ninfluence--in fact she said so to her grandmother.  She has an\\nunbounded admiration for you.  Poor Ellen--she was always a wayward\\nchild.  I wonder what her fate will be?\"\\n\\n\"What we\\'ve all contrived to make it,\" he felt like answering.  \"If\\nyou\\'d all of you rather she should be Beaufort\\'s mistress than some\\ndecent fellow\\'s wife you\\'ve certainly gone the right way about it.\"\\n\\nHe wondered what Mrs. Welland would have said if he had uttered the\\nwords instead of merely thinking them.  He could picture the sudden\\ndecomposure of her firm placid features, to which a lifelong mastery\\nover trifles had given an air of factitious authority.  Traces still\\nlingered on them of a fresh beauty like her daughter\\'s; and he asked\\nhimself if May\\'s face was doomed to thicken into the same middle-aged\\nimage of invincible innocence.\\n\\nAh, no, he did not want May to have that kind of innocence, the\\ninnocence that seals the mind against imagination and the heart against\\nexperience!\\n\\n\"I verily believe,\" Mrs. Welland continued, \"that if the horrible\\nbusiness had come out in the newspapers it would have been my husband\\'s\\ndeath-blow.  I don\\'t know any of the details; I only ask not to, as I\\ntold poor Ellen when she tried to talk to me about it.  Having an\\ninvalid to care for, I have to keep my mind bright and happy.  But Mr.\\nWelland was terribly upset; he had a slight temperature every morning\\nwhile we were waiting to hear what had been decided.  It was the horror\\nof his girl\\'s learning that such things were possible--but of course,\\ndear Newland, you felt that too.  We all knew that you were thinking of\\nMay.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m always thinking of May,\" the young man rejoined, rising to cut\\nshort the conversation.\\n\\nHe had meant to seize the opportunity of his private talk with Mrs.\\nWelland to urge her to advance the date of his marriage.  But he could\\nthink of no arguments that would move her, and with a sense of relief\\nhe saw Mr. Welland and May driving up to the door.\\n\\nHis only hope was to plead again with May, and on the day before his\\ndeparture he walked with her to the ruinous garden of the Spanish\\nMission.  The background lent itself to allusions to European scenes;\\nand May, who was looking her loveliest under a wide-brimmed hat that\\ncast a shadow of mystery over her too-clear eyes, kindled into\\neagerness as he spoke of Granada and the Alhambra.\\n\\n\"We might be seeing it all this spring--even the Easter ceremonies at\\nSeville,\" he urged, exaggerating his demands in the hope of a larger\\nconcession.\\n\\n\"Easter in Seville?  And it will be Lent next week!\" she laughed.\\n\\n\"Why shouldn\\'t we be married in Lent?\" he rejoined; but she looked so\\nshocked that he saw his mistake.\\n\\n\"Of course I didn\\'t mean that, dearest; but soon after Easter--so that\\nwe could sail at the end of April.  I know I could arrange it at the\\noffice.\"\\n\\nShe smiled dreamily upon the possibility; but he perceived that to\\ndream of it sufficed her.  It was like hearing him read aloud out of\\nhis poetry books the beautiful things that could not possibly happen in\\nreal life.\\n\\n\"Oh, do go on, Newland; I do love your descriptions.\"\\n\\n\"But why should they be only descriptions?  Why shouldn\\'t we make them\\nreal?\"\\n\\n\"We shall, dearest, of course; next year.\"  Her voice lingered over it.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you want them to be real sooner?  Can\\'t I persuade you to break\\naway now?\"\\n\\nShe bowed her head, vanishing from him under her conniving hat-brim.\\n\\n\"Why should we dream away another year?  Look at me, dear!  Don\\'t you\\nunderstand how I want you for my wife?\"\\n\\nFor a moment she remained motionless; then she raised on him eyes of\\nsuch despairing dearness that he half-released her waist from his hold.\\nBut suddenly her look changed and deepened inscrutably.  \"I\\'m not sure\\nif I DO understand,\" she said.  \"Is it--is it because you\\'re not\\ncertain of continuing to care for me?\"\\n\\nArcher sprang up from his seat.  \"My God--perhaps--I don\\'t know,\" he\\nbroke out angrily.\\n\\nMay Welland rose also; as they faced each other she seemed to grow in\\nwomanly stature and dignity.  Both were silent for a moment, as if\\ndismayed by the unforeseen trend of their words: then she said in a low\\nvoice: \"If that is it--is there some one else?\"\\n\\n\"Some one else--between you and me?\"  He echoed her words slowly, as\\nthough they were only half-intelligible and he wanted time to repeat\\nthe question to himself.  She seemed to catch the uncertainty of his\\nvoice, for she went on in a deepening tone:  \"Let us talk frankly,\\nNewland.  Sometimes I\\'ve felt a difference in you; especially since our\\nengagement has been announced.\"\\n\\n\"Dear--what madness!\" he recovered himself to exclaim.\\n\\nShe met his protest with a faint smile.  \"If it is, it won\\'t hurt us to\\ntalk about it.\"  She paused, and added, lifting her head with one of\\nher noble movements:  \"Or even if it\\'s true: why shouldn\\'t we speak of\\nit?  You might so easily have made a mistake.\"\\n\\nHe lowered his head, staring at the black leaf-pattern on the sunny\\npath at their feet.  \"Mistakes are always easy to make; but if I had\\nmade one of the kind you suggest, is it likely that I should be\\nimploring you to hasten our marriage?\"\\n\\nShe looked downward too, disturbing the pattern with the point of her\\nsunshade while she struggled for expression.  \"Yes,\" she said at\\nlength.  \"You might want--once for all--to settle the question: it\\'s\\none way.\"\\n\\nHer quiet lucidity startled him, but did not mislead him into thinking\\nher insensible.  Under her hat-brim he saw the pallor of her profile,\\nand a slight tremor of the nostril above her resolutely steadied lips.\\n\\n\"Well--?\" he questioned, sitting down on the bench, and looking up at\\nher with a frown that he tried to make playful.\\n\\nShe dropped back into her seat and went on:  \"You mustn\\'t think that a\\ngirl knows as little as her parents imagine.  One hears and one\\nnotices--one has one\\'s feelings and ideas.  And of course, long before\\nyou told me that you cared for me, I\\'d known that there was some one\\nelse you were interested in; every one was talking about it two years\\nago at Newport.  And once I saw you sitting together on the verandah at\\na dance--and when she came back into the house her face was sad, and I\\nfelt sorry for her; I remembered it afterward, when we were engaged.\"\\n\\nHer voice had sunk almost to a whisper, and she sat clasping and\\nunclasping her hands about the handle of her sunshade.  The young man\\nlaid his upon them with a gentle pressure; his heart dilated with an\\ninexpressible relief.\\n\\n\"My dear child--was THAT it?  If you only knew the truth!\"\\n\\nShe raised her head quickly.  \"Then there is a truth I don\\'t know?\"\\n\\nHe kept his hand over hers.  \"I meant, the truth about the old story\\nyou speak of.\"\\n\\n\"But that\\'s what I want to know, Newland--what I ought to know.  I\\ncouldn\\'t have my happiness made out of a wrong--an unfairness--to\\nsomebody else.  And I want to believe that it would be the same with\\nyou.  What sort of a life could we build on such foundations?\"\\n\\nHer face had taken on a look of such tragic courage that he felt like\\nbowing himself down at her feet.  \"I\\'ve wanted to say this for a long\\ntime,\" she went on.  \"I\\'ve wanted to tell you that, when two people\\nreally love each other, I understand that there may be situations which\\nmake it right that they should--should go against public opinion.  And\\nif you feel yourself in any way pledged ... pledged to the person we\\'ve\\nspoken of ...  and if there is any way ... any way in which you can\\nfulfill your pledge ... even by her getting a divorce ...  Newland,\\ndon\\'t give her up because of me!\"\\n\\nHis surprise at discovering that her fears had fastened upon an episode\\nso remote and so completely of the past as his love-affair with Mrs.\\nThorley Rushworth gave way to wonder at the generosity of her view.\\nThere was something superhuman in an attitude so recklessly unorthodox,\\nand if other problems had not pressed on him he would have been lost in\\nwonder at the prodigy of the Wellands\\' daughter urging him to marry his\\nformer mistress.  But he was still dizzy with the glimpse of the\\nprecipice they had skirted, and full of a new awe at the mystery of\\nyoung-girlhood.\\n\\nFor a moment he could not speak; then he said: \"There is no pledge--no\\nobligation whatever--of the kind you think.  Such cases don\\'t\\nalways--present themselves quite as simply as ... But that\\'s no matter\\n... I love your generosity, because I feel as you do about those things\\n... I feel that each case must be judged individually, on its own\\nmerits ... irrespective of stupid conventionalities ... I mean, each\\nwoman\\'s right to her liberty--\"  He pulled himself up, startled by the\\nturn his thoughts had taken, and went on, looking at her with a smile:\\n\"Since you understand so many things, dearest, can\\'t you go a little\\nfarther, and understand the uselessness of our submitting to another\\nform of the same foolish conventionalities?  If there\\'s no one and\\nnothing between us, isn\\'t that an argument for marrying quickly, rather\\nthan for more delay?\"\\n\\nShe flushed with joy and lifted her face to his; as he bent to it he\\nsaw that her eyes were full of happy tears.  But in another moment she\\nseemed to have descended from her womanly eminence to helpless and\\ntimorous girlhood; and he understood that her courage and initiative\\nwere all for others, and that she had none for herself.  It was evident\\nthat the effort of speaking had been much greater than her studied\\ncomposure betrayed, and that at his first word of reassurance she had\\ndropped back into the usual, as a too-adventurous child takes refuge in\\nits mother\\'s arms.\\n\\nArcher had no heart to go on pleading with her; he was too much\\ndisappointed at the vanishing of the new being who had cast that one\\ndeep look at him from her transparent eyes.  May seemed to be aware of\\nhis disappointment, but without knowing how to alleviate it; and they\\nstood up and walked silently home.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Ah, these Mingotts--all alike!  Born in a\\nrut, and you can\\'t root \\'em out of it.  When I built this house you\\'d\\nhave thought I was moving to California!  Nobody ever HAD built above\\nFortieth Street--no, says I, nor above the Battery either, before\\nChristopher Columbus discovered America.  No, no; not one of them wants\\nto be different; they\\'re as scared of it as the small-pox.  Ah, my dear\\nMr. Archer, I thank my stars I\\'m nothing but a vulgar Spicer; but\\nthere\\'s not one of my own children that takes after me but my little\\nEllen.\"  She broke off, still twinkling at him, and asked, with the\\ncasual irrelevance of old age:  \"Now, why in the world didn\\'t you marry\\nmy little Ellen?\"\\n\\nArcher laughed.  \"For one thing, she wasn\\'t there to be married.\"\\n\\n\"No--to be sure; more\\'s the pity.  And now it\\'s too late; her life is\\nfinished.\"  She spoke with the cold-blooded complacency of the aged\\nthrowing earth into the grave of young hopes.  The young man\\'s heart\\ngrew chill, and he said hurriedly:  \"Can\\'t I persuade you to use your\\ninfluence with the Wellands, Mrs. Mingott?  I wasn\\'t made for long\\nengagements.\"\\n\\nOld Catherine beamed on him approvingly.  \"No; I can see that.  You\\'ve\\ngot a quick eye.

Her face looked vivid and\\nhappy, and she held out her hand gaily to Archer while she stooped to\\nher grandmother\\'s kiss.\\n\\n\"I was just saying to him, my dear:  \\'Now, why didn\\'t you marry my\\nlittle Ellen?\\'\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska looked at Archer, still smiling.  \"And what did he\\nanswer?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, my darling, I leave you to find that out!  He\\'s been down to\\nFlorida to see his sweetheart.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know.\"  She still looked at him.  \"I went to see your mother,\\nto ask where you\\'d gone.  I sent a note that you never answered, and I\\nwas afraid you were ill.\"\\n\\nHe muttered something about leaving unexpectedly, in a great hurry, and\\nhaving intended to write to her from St. Augustine.\\n\\n\"And of course once you were there you never thought of me again!\"  She\\ncontinued to beam on him with a gaiety that might have been a studied\\nassumption of indifference.\\n\\n\"If she still needs me, she\\'s determined not to let me see it,\" he\\nthought, stung by her manner.  He wanted to thank her for having been\\nto see his mother, but under the ancestress\\'s malicious eye he felt\\nhimself tongue-tied and constrained.\\n\\n\"Look at him--in such hot haste to get married that he took French\\nleave and rushed down to implore the silly girl on his knees!  That\\'s\\nsomething like a lover--that\\'s the way handsome Bob Spicer carried off\\nmy poor mother; and then got tired of her before I was weaned--though\\nthey only had to wait eight months for me!  But there--you\\'re not a\\nSpicer, young man; luckily for you and for May.  It\\'s only my poor\\nEllen that has kept any of their wicked blood; the rest of them are all\\nmodel Mingotts,\" cried the old lady scornfully.\\n\\nArcher was aware that Madame Olenska, who had seated herself at her\\ngrandmother\\'s side, was still thoughtfully scrutinising him.  The\\ngaiety had faded from her eyes, and she said with great gentleness:\\n\"Surely, Granny, we can persuade them between us to do as he wishes.\"\\n\\nArcher rose to go, and as his hand met Madame Olenska\\'s he felt that\\nshe was waiting for him to make some allusion to her unanswered letter.\\n\\n\"When can I see you?\" he asked, as she walked with him to the door of\\nthe room.\\n\\n\"Whenever you like; but it must be soon if you want to see the little\\nhouse again.  I am moving next week.\"\\n\\nA pang shot through him at the memory of his lamplit hours in the\\nlow-studded drawing-room.  Few as they had been, they were thick with\\nmemories.\\n\\n\"Tomorrow evening?\"\\n\\nShe nodded.  \"Tomorrow; yes; but early.  I\\'m going out.\"\\n\\nThe next day was a Sunday, and if she were \"going out\" on a Sunday\\nevening it could, of course, be only to Mrs. Lemuel Struthers\\'s.  He\\nfelt a slight movement of annoyance, not so much at her going there\\n(for he rather liked her going where she pleased in spite of the van\\nder Luydens), but because it was the kind of house at which she was\\nsure to meet Beaufort, where she must have known beforehand that she\\nwould meet him--and where she was probably going for that purpose.\\n\\n\"Very well; tomorrow evening,\" he repeated, inwardly resolved that he\\nwould not go early, and that by reaching her door late he would either\\nprevent her from going to Mrs. Struthers\\'s, or else arrive after she\\nhad started--which, all things considered, would no doubt be the\\nsimplest solution.\\n\\n\\nIt was only half-past eight, after all, when he rang the bell under the\\nwisteria; not as late as he had intended by half an hour--but a\\nsingular restlessness had driven him to her door.  He reflected,\\nhowever, that Mrs. Struthers\\'s Sunday evenings were not like a ball,\\nand that her guests, as if to minimise their delinquency, usually went\\nearly.\\n\\nThe one thing he had not counted on, in entering Madame Olenska\\'s hall,\\nwas to find hats and overcoats there.  Why had she bidden him to come\\nearly if she was having people to dine?  On a closer inspection of the\\ngarments besides which Nastasia was laying his own, his resentment gave\\nway to curiosity.  The overcoats were in fact the very strangest he had\\never seen under a polite roof; and it took but a glance to assure\\nhimself that neither of them belonged to Julius Beaufort.  One was a\\nshaggy yellow ulster of \"reach-me-down\" cut, the other a very old and\\nrusty cloak with a cape--something like what the French called a\\n\"Macfarlane.\" This garment, which appeared to be made for a person of\\nprodigious size, had evidently seen long and hard wear, and its\\ngreenish-black folds gave out a moist sawdusty smell suggestive of\\nprolonged sessions against bar-room walls.  On it lay a ragged grey\\nscarf and an odd felt hat of semiclerical shape.\\n\\nArcher raised his eyebrows enquiringly at Nastasia, who raised hers in\\nreturn with a fatalistic \"Gia!\" as she threw open the drawing-room door.\\n\\nThe young man saw at once that his hostess was not in the room; then,\\nwith surprise, he discovered another lady standing by the fire.  This\\nlady, who was long, lean and loosely put together, was clad in raiment\\nintricately looped and fringed, with plaids and stripes and bands of\\nplain colour disposed in a design to which the clue seemed missing.\\nHer hair, which had tried to turn white and only succeeded in fading,\\nwas surmounted by a Spanish comb and black lace scarf, and silk\\nmittens, visibly darned, covered her rheumatic hands.\\n\\nBeside her, in a cloud of cigar-smoke, stood the owners of the two\\novercoats, both in morning clothes that they had evidently not taken\\noff since morning.  In one of the two, Archer, to his surprise,\\nrecognised Ned Winsett; the other and older, who was unknown to him,\\nand whose gigantic frame declared him to be the wearer of the\\n\"Macfarlane,\" had a feebly leonine head with crumpled grey hair, and\\nmoved his arms with large pawing gestures, as though he were\\ndistributing lay blessings to a kneeling multitude.\\n\\nThese three persons stood together on the hearth-rug, their eyes fixed\\non an extraordinarily large bouquet of crimson roses, with a knot of\\npurple pansies at their base, that lay on the sofa where Madame Olenska\\nusually sat.\\n\\n\"What they must have cost at this season--though of course it\\'s the\\nsentiment one cares about!\" the lady was saying in a sighing staccato\\nas Archer came in.\\n\\nThe three turned with surprise at his appearance, and the lady,\\nadvancing, held out her hand.\\n\\n\"Dear Mr. Archer--almost my cousin Newland!\" she said.  \"I am the\\nMarchioness Manson.\"\\n\\nArcher bowed, and she continued:  \"My Ellen has taken me in for a few\\ndays.  I came from Cuba, where I have been spending the winter with\\nSpanish friends--such delightful distinguished people: the highest\\nnobility of old Castile--how I wish you could know them!  But I was\\ncalled away by our dear great friend here, Dr. Carver.  You don\\'t know\\nDr. Agathon Carver, founder of the Valley of Love Community?\"\\n\\nDr. Carver inclined his leonine head, and the Marchioness continued:\\n\"Ah, New York--New York--how little the life of the spirit has reached\\nit!  But I see you do know Mr. Winsett.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes--I reached him some time ago; but not by that route,\" Winsett\\nsaid with his dry smile.\\n\\nThe Marchioness shook her head reprovingly.  \"How do you know, Mr.\\nWinsett?  The spirit bloweth where it listeth.\"\\n\\n\"List--oh, list!\" interjected Dr. Carver in a stentorian murmur.\\n\\n\"But do sit down, Mr. Archer.  We four have been having a delightful\\nlittle dinner together, and my child has gone up to dress.  She expects\\nyou; she will be down in a moment.  We were just admiring these\\nmarvellous flowers, which will surprise her when she reappears.\"\\n\\nWinsett remained on his feet.  \"I\\'m afraid I must be off.  Please tell\\nMadame Olenska that we shall all feel lost when she abandons our\\nstreet.  This house has been an oasis.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, but she won\\'t abandon YOU.  Poetry and art are the breath of life\\nto her.  It IS poetry you write, Mr. Winsett?\"\\n\\n\"Well, no; but I sometimes read it,\" said Winsett, including the group\\nin a general nod and slipping out of the room.\\n\\n\"A caustic spirit--un peu sauvage.  But so witty; Dr. Carver, you DO\\nthink him witty?\"\\n\\n\"I never think of wit,\" said Dr. Carver severely.\\n\\n\"Ah--ah--you never think of wit!  How merciless he is to us weak\\nmortals, Mr. Archer!  But he lives only in the life of the spirit; and\\ntonight he is mentally preparing the lecture he is to deliver presently\\nat Mrs. Blenker\\'s.  Dr. Carver, would there be time, before you start\\nfor the Blenkers\\' to explain to Mr. Archer your illuminating discovery\\nof the Direct Contact?  But no; I see it is nearly nine o\\'clock, and we\\nhave no right to detain you while so many are waiting for your message.\"\\n\\nDr. Carver looked slightly disappointed at this conclusion, but, having\\ncompared his ponderous gold time-piece with Madame Olenska\\'s little\\ntravelling-clock, he reluctantly gathered up his mighty limbs for\\ndeparture.\\n\\n\"I shall see you later, dear friend?\" he suggested to the Marchioness,\\nwho replied with a smile:  \"As soon as Ellen\\'s carriage comes I will\\njoin you; I do hope the lecture won\\'t have begun.\"\\n\\nDr. Carver looked thoughtfully at Archer.  \"Perhaps, if this young\\ngentleman is interested in my experiences, Mrs. Blenker might allow you\\nto bring him with you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear friend, if it were possible--I am sure she would be too\\nhappy.  But I fear my Ellen counts on Mr. Archer herself.\"\\n\\n\"That,\" said Dr. Carver, \"is unfortunate--but here is my card.\"  He\\nhanded it to Archer, who read on it, in Gothic characters:\\n\\n  +---------------------------+\\n  |      Agathon Carver       |\\n  |    The Valley of Love     |\\n  |   Kittasquattamy, N. Y.   |\\n  +---------------------------+\\n\\n\\nDr. Carver bowed himself out, and Mrs. Manson, with a sigh that might\\nhave been either of regret or relief, again waved Archer to a seat.\\n\\n\"Ellen will be down in a moment; and before she comes, I am so glad of\\nthis quiet moment with you.\"\\n\\nArcher murmured his pleasure at their meeting, and the Marchioness\\ncontinued, in her low sighing accents: \"I know everything, dear Mr.\\nArcher--my child has told me all you have done for her.  Your wise\\nadvice: your courageous firmness--thank heaven it was not too late!\"\\n\\nThe young man listened with considerable embarrassment.  Was there any\\none, he wondered, to whom Madame Olenska had not proclaimed his\\nintervention in her private affairs?\\n\\n\"Madame Olenska exaggerates; I simply gave her a legal opinion, as she\\nasked me to.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, but in doing it--in doing it you were the unconscious instrument\\nof--of--what word have we moderns for Providence, Mr. Archer?\" cried\\nthe lady, tilting her head on one side and drooping her lids\\nmysteriously.  \"Little did you know that at that very moment I was\\nbeing appealed to: being approached, in fact--from the other side of\\nthe Atlantic!\"\\n\\nShe glanced over her shoulder, as though fearful of being overheard,\\nand then, drawing her chair nearer, and raising a tiny ivory fan to her\\nlips, breathed behind it:  \"By the Count himself--my poor, mad, foolish\\nOlenski; who asks only to take her back on her own terms.\"\\n\\n\"Good God!\" Archer exclaimed, springing up.\\n\\n\"You are horrified?  Yes, of course; I understand.  I don\\'t defend poor\\nStanislas, though he has always called me his best friend.  He does not\\ndefend himself--he casts himself at her feet: in my person.\"  She\\ntapped her emaciated bosom.  \"I have his letter here.\"\\n\\n\"A letter?--Has Madame Olenska seen it?\" Archer stammered, his brain\\nwhirling with the shock of the announcement.\\n\\nThe Marchioness Manson shook her head softly.  \"Time--time; I must have\\ntime.  I know my Ellen--haughty, intractable; shall I say, just a shade\\nunforgiving?\"\\n\\n\"But, good heavens, to forgive is one thing; to go back into that\\nhell--\"\\n\\n\"Ah, yes,\" the Marchioness acquiesced.  \"So she describes it--my\\nsensitive child!  But on the material side, Mr. Archer, if one may\\nstoop to consider such things; do you know what she is giving up?\\nThose roses there on the sofa--acres like them, under glass and in the\\nopen, in his matchless terraced gardens at Nice!  Jewels--historic\\npearls: the Sobieski emeralds--sables,--but she cares nothing for all\\nthese!  Art and beauty, those she does care for, she lives for, as I\\nalways have; and those also surrounded her.  Pictures, priceless\\nfurniture, music, brilliant conversation--ah, that, my dear young man,\\nif you\\'ll excuse me, is what you\\'ve no conception of here!  And she had\\nit all; and the homage of the greatest.  She tells me she is not\\nthought handsome in New York--good heavens!  Her portrait has been\\npainted nine times; the greatest artists in Europe have begged for the\\nprivilege.  Are these things nothing?  And the remorse of an adoring\\nhusband?\"\\n\\nAs the Marchioness Manson rose to her climax her face assumed an\\nexpression of ecstatic retrospection which would have moved Archer\\'s\\nmirth had he not been numb with amazement.\\n\\nHe would have laughed if any one had foretold to him that his first\\nsight of poor Medora Manson would have been in the guise of a messenger\\nof Satan; but he was in no mood for laughing now, and she seemed to him\\nto come straight out of the hell from which Ellen Olenska had just\\nescaped.\\n\\n\"She knows nothing yet--of all this?\" he asked abruptly.\\n\\nMrs. Manson laid a purple finger on her lips.  \"Nothing directly--but\\ndoes she suspect?  Who can tell?  The truth is, Mr. Archer, I have been\\nwaiting to see you.  From the moment I heard of the firm stand you had\\ntaken, and of your influence over her, I hoped it might be possible to\\ncount on your support--to convince you ...\"\\n\\n\"That she ought to go back?  I would rather see her dead!\" cried the\\nyoung man violently.\\n\\n\"Ah,\" the Marchioness murmured, without visible resentment.  For a\\nwhile she sat in her arm-chair, opening and shutting the absurd ivory\\nfan between her mittened fingers; but suddenly she lifted her head and\\nlistened.\\n\\n\"Here she comes,\" she said in a rapid whisper; and then, pointing to\\nthe bouquet on the sofa:  \"Am I to understand that you prefer THAT, Mr.\\nArcher?  After all, marriage is marriage ... and my niece is still a\\nwife...\"\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              " [{'chapter-content': '\\nIt invariably happened in the same way.\\n\\nMrs. Julius Beaufort, on the night of her annual ball, never failed to\\nappear at the Opera; indeed, she always gave her ball on an Opera night\\nin order to emphasise her complete superiority to household cares, and\\nher possession of a staff of servants competent to organise every\\ndetail of the entertainment in her absence.\\n\\nThe Beauforts\\' house was one of the few in New York that possessed a\\nball-room (it antedated even Mrs. Manson Mingott\\'s and the Headly\\nChiverses\\'); and at a time when it was beginning to be thought\\n\"provincial\" to put a \"crash\" over the drawing-room floor and move the\\nfurniture upstairs, the possession of a ball-room that was used for no\\nother purpose, and left for three-hundred-and-sixty-four days of the\\nyear to shuttered darkness, with its gilt chairs stacked in a corner\\nand its chandelier in a bag; this undoubted superiority was felt to\\ncompensate for whatever was regrettable in the Beaufort past.\\n\\nMrs. Archer, who was fond of coining her social philosophy into axioms,\\nhad once said:  \"We all have our pet common people--\" and though the\\nphrase was a daring one, its truth was secretly admitted in many an\\nexclusive bosom.  But the Beauforts were not exactly common; some\\npeople said they were even worse.  Mrs. Beaufort belonged indeed to one\\nof America\\'s most honoured families; she had been the lovely Regina\\nDallas (of the South Carolina branch), a penniless beauty introduced to\\nNew York society by her cousin, the imprudent Medora Manson, who was\\nalways doing the wrong thing from the right motive.  When one was\\nrelated to the Mansons and the Rushworths one had a \"droit de cite\" (as\\nMr. Sillerton Jackson, who had frequented the Tuileries, called it) in\\nNew York society; but did one not forfeit it in marrying Julius\\nBeaufort?\\n\\nThe question was: who was Beaufort?  He passed for an Englishman, was\\nagreeable, handsome, ill-tempered, hospitable and witty.  He had come\\nto America with letters of recommendation from old Mrs. Manson\\nMingott\\'s English son-in-law, the banker, and had speedily made himself\\nan important position in the world of affairs; but his habits were\\ndissipated, his tongue was bitter, his antecedents were mysterious; and\\nwhen Medora Manson announced her cousin\\'s engagement to him it was felt\\nto be one more act of folly in poor Medora\\'s long record of imprudences.\\n\\nBut folly is as often justified of her children as wisdom, and two\\nyears after young Mrs. Beaufort\\'s marriage it was admitted that she had\\nthe most distinguished house in New York.  No one knew exactly how the\\nmiracle was accomplished.  She was indolent, passive, the caustic even\\ncalled her dull; but dressed like an idol, hung with pearls, growing\\nyounger and blonder and more beautiful each year, she throned in Mr.\\nBeaufort\\'s heavy brown-stone palace, and drew all the world there\\nwithout lifting her jewelled little finger.  The knowing people said it\\nwas Beaufort himself who trained the servants, taught the chef new\\ndishes, told the gardeners what hot-house flowers to grow for the\\ndinner-table and the drawing-rooms, selected the guests, brewed the\\nafter-dinner punch and dictated the little notes his wife wrote to her\\nfriends.  If he did, these domestic activities were privately\\nperformed, and he presented to the world the appearance of a careless\\nand hospitable millionaire strolling into his own drawing-room with the\\ndetachment of an invited guest, and saying:  \"My wife\\'s gloxinias are a\\nmarvel, aren\\'t they?  I believe she gets them out from Kew.\"\\n\\nMr. Beaufort\\'s secret, people were agreed, was the way he carried\\nthings off.  It was all very well to whisper that he had been \"helped\"\\nto leave England by the international banking-house in which he had\\nbeen employed; he carried off that rumour as easily as the rest--though\\nNew York\\'s business conscience was no less sensitive than its moral\\nstandard--he carried everything before him, and all New York into his\\ndrawing-rooms, and for over twenty years now people had said they were\\n\"going to the Beauforts\\'\" with the same tone of security as if they had\\nsaid they were going to Mrs. Manson Mingott\\'s, and with the added\\nsatisfaction of knowing they would get hot canvas-back ducks and\\nvintage wines, instead of tepid Veuve Clicquot without a year and\\nwarmed-up croquettes from Philadelphia.\\n\\nMrs. Beaufort, then, had as usual appeared in her box just before the\\nJewel Song; and when, again as usual, she rose at the end of the third\\nact, drew her opera cloak about her lovely shoulders, and disappeared,\\nNew York knew that meant that half an hour later the ball would begin.\\n\\nThe Beaufort house was one that New Yorkers were proud to show to\\nforeigners, especially on the night of the annual ball.  The Beauforts\\nhad been among the first people in New York to own their own red velvet\\ncarpet and have it rolled down the steps by their own footmen, under\\ntheir own awning, instead of hiring it with the supper and the\\nball-room chairs.  They had also inaugurated the custom of letting the\\nladies take their cloaks off in the hall, instead of shuffling up to\\nthe hostess\\'s bedroom and recurling their hair with the aid of the\\ngas-burner; Beaufort was understood to have said that he supposed all\\nhis wife\\'s friends had maids who saw to it that they were properly\\ncoiffees when they left home.\\n\\nThen the house had been boldly planned with a ball-room, so that,\\ninstead of squeezing through a narrow passage to get to it (as at the\\nChiverses\\') one marched solemnly down a vista of enfiladed\\ndrawing-rooms (the sea-green, the crimson and the bouton d\\'or), seeing\\nfrom afar the many-candled lustres reflected in the polished parquetry,\\nand beyond that the depths of a conservatory where camellias and\\ntree-ferns arched their costly foliage over seats of black and gold\\nbamboo.\\n\\nNewland Archer, as became a young man of his position, strolled in\\nsomewhat late.  He had left his overcoat with the silk-stockinged\\nfootmen (the stockings were one of Beaufort\\'s few fatuities), had\\ndawdled a while in the library hung with Spanish leather and furnished\\nwith Buhl and malachite, where a few men were chatting and putting on\\ntheir dancing-gloves, and had finally joined the line of guests whom\\nMrs. Beaufort was receiving on the threshold of the crimson\\ndrawing-room.\\n\\nArcher was distinctly nervous.  He had not gone back to his club after\\nthe Opera (as the young bloods usually did), but, the night being fine,\\nhad walked for some distance up Fifth Avenue before turning back in the\\ndirection of the Beauforts\\' house.  He was definitely afraid that the\\nMingotts might be going too far; that, in fact, they might have Granny\\nMingott\\'s orders to bring the Countess Olenska to the ball.\\n\\nFrom the tone of the club box he had perceived how grave a mistake that\\nwould be; and, though he was more than ever determined to \"see the\\nthing through,\" he felt less chivalrously eager to champion his\\nbetrothed\\'s cousin than before their brief talk at the Opera.\\n\\nWandering on to the bouton d\\'or drawing-room (where Beaufort had had\\nthe audacity to hang \"Love Victorious,\" the much-discussed nude of\\nBouguereau) Archer found Mrs. Welland and her daughter standing near\\nthe ball-room door.  Couples were already gliding over the floor\\nbeyond: the light of the wax candles fell on revolving tulle skirts, on\\ngirlish heads wreathed with modest blossoms, on the dashing aigrettes\\nand ornaments of the young married women\\'s coiffures, and on the\\nglitter of highly glazed shirt-fronts and fresh glace gloves.\\n\\nMiss Welland, evidently about to join the dancers, hung on the\\nthreshold, her lilies-of-the-valley in her hand (she carried no other\\nbouquet), her face a little pale, her eyes burning with a candid\\nexcitement.  A group of young men and girls were gathered about her,\\nand there was much hand-clasping, laughing and pleasantry on which Mrs.\\nWelland, standing slightly apart, shed the beam of a qualified\\napproval.  It was evident that Miss Welland was in the act of\\nannouncing her engagement, while her mother affected the air of\\nparental reluctance considered suitable to the occasion.\\n\\nArcher paused a moment.  It was at his express wish that the\\nannouncement had been made, and yet it was not thus that he would have\\nwished to have his happiness known.  To proclaim it in the heat and\\nnoise of a crowded ball-room was to rob it of the fine bloom of privacy\\nwhich should belong to things nearest the heart.  His joy was so deep\\nthat this blurring of the surface left its essence untouched; but he\\nwould have liked to keep the surface pure too.  It was something of a\\nsatisfaction to find that May Welland shared this feeling.  Her eyes\\nfled to his beseechingly, and their look said:  \"Remember, we\\'re doing\\nthis because it\\'s right.\"\\n\\nNo appeal could have found a more immediate response in Archer\\'s\\nbreast; but he wished that the necessity of their action had been\\nrepresented by some ideal reason, and not simply by poor Ellen Olenska.\\nThe group about Miss Welland made way for him with significant smiles,\\nand after taking his share of the felicitations he drew his betrothed\\ninto the middle of the ball-room floor and put his arm about her waist.\\n\\n\"Now we shan\\'t have to talk,\" he said, smiling into her candid eyes, as\\nthey floated away on the soft waves of the Blue Danube.\\n\\nShe made no answer.  Her lips trembled into a smile, but the eyes\\nremained distant and serious, as if bent on some ineffable vision.\\n\"Dear,\" Archer whispered, pressing her to him: it was borne in on him\\nthat the first hours of being engaged, even if spent in a ball-room,\\nhad in them something grave and sacramental.  What a new life it was\\ngoing to be, with this whiteness, radiance, goodness at one\\'s side!\\n\\nThe dance over, the two, as became an affianced couple, wandered into\\nthe conservatory; and sitting behind a tall screen of tree-ferns and\\ncamellias Newland pressed her gloved hand to his lips.\\n\\n\"You see I did as you asked me to,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Yes: I couldn\\'t wait,\" he answered smiling.  After a moment he added:\\n\"Only I wish it hadn\\'t had to be at a ball.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know.\"  She met his glance comprehendingly.  \"But after\\nall--even here we\\'re alone together, aren\\'t we?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dearest--always!\" Archer cried.\\n\\nEvidently she was always going to understand; she was always going to\\nsay the right thing.  The discovery made the cup of his bliss overflow,\\nand he went on gaily:  \"The worst of it is that I want to kiss you and\\nI can\\'t.\"  As he spoke he took a swift glance about the conservatory,\\nassured himself of their momentary privacy, and catching her to him\\nlaid a fugitive pressure on her lips.  To counteract the audacity of\\nthis proceeding he led her to a bamboo sofa in a less secluded part of\\nthe conservatory, and sitting down beside her broke a\\nlily-of-the-valley from her bouquet.  She sat silent, and the world lay\\nlike a sunlit valley at their feet.\\n\\n\"Did you tell my cousin Ellen?\" she asked presently, as if she spoke\\nthrough a dream.\\n\\nHe roused himself, and remembered that he had not done so.  Some\\ninvincible repugnance to speak of such things to the strange foreign\\nwoman had checked the words on his lips.\\n\\n\"No--I hadn\\'t the chance after all,\" he said, fibbing hastily.\\n\\n\"Ah.\"  She looked disappointed, but gently resolved on gaining her\\npoint.  \"You must, then, for I didn\\'t either; and I shouldn\\'t like her\\nto think--\"\\n\\n\"Of course not.  But aren\\'t you, after all, the person to do it?\"\\n\\nShe pondered on this.  \"If I\\'d done it at the right time, yes: but now\\nthat there\\'s been a delay I think you must explain that I\\'d asked you\\nto tell her at the Opera, before our speaking about it to everybody\\nhere.  Otherwise she might think I had forgotten her.  You see, she\\'s\\none of the family, and she\\'s been away so long that she\\'s\\nrather--sensitive.\"\\n\\nArcher looked at her glowingly.  \"Dear and great angel!  Of course I\\'ll\\ntell her.\"  He glanced a trifle apprehensively toward the crowded\\nball-room.  \"But I haven\\'t seen her yet.  Has she come?\"\\n\\n\"No; at the last minute she decided not to.\"\\n\\n\"At the last minute?\" he echoed, betraying his surprise that she should\\never have considered the alternative possible.\\n\\n\"Yes.  She\\'s awfully fond of dancing,\" the young girl answered simply.\\n\"But suddenly she made up her mind that her dress wasn\\'t smart enough\\nfor a ball, though we thought it so lovely; and so my aunt had to take\\nher home.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, well--\" said Archer with happy indifference.  Nothing about his\\nbetrothed pleased him more than her resolute determination to carry to\\nits utmost limit that ritual of ignoring the \"unpleasant\" in which they\\nhad both been brought up.\\n\\n\"She knows as well as I do,\" he reflected, \"the real reason of her\\ncousin\\'s staying away; but I shall never let her see by the least sign\\nthat I am conscious of there being a shadow of a shade on poor Ellen\\nOlenska\\'s reputation.\"\\n\\n\\n',\n",

In the galleries the enthusiasm was unreserved; in\\nthe stalls and boxes, people smiled a little at the hackneyed\\nsentiments and clap-trap situations, and enjoyed the play as much as\\nthe galleries did.\\n\\nThere was one episode, in particular, that held the house from floor to\\nceiling.  It was that in which Harry Montague, after a sad, almost\\nmonosyllabic scene of parting with Miss Dyas, bade her good-bye, and\\nturned to go.  The actress, who was standing near the mantelpiece and\\nlooking down into the fire, wore a gray cashmere dress without\\nfashionable loopings or trimmings, moulded to her tall figure and\\nflowing in long lines about her feet.  Around her neck was a narrow\\nblack velvet ribbon with the ends falling down her back.\\n\\nWhen her wooer turned from her she rested her arms against the\\nmantel-shelf and bowed her face in her hands.  On the threshold he\\npaused to look at her; then he stole back, lifted one of the ends of\\nvelvet ribbon, kissed it, and left the room without her hearing him or\\nchanging her attitude.  And on this silent parting the curtain fell.\\n\\nIt was always for the sake of that particular scene that Newland Archer\\nwent to see \"The Shaughraun.\" He thought the adieux of Montague and Ada\\nDyas as fine as anything he had ever seen Croisette and Bressant do in\\nParis, or Madge Robertson and Kendal in London; in its reticence, its\\ndumb sorrow, it moved him more than the most famous histrionic\\noutpourings.\\n\\nOn the evening in question the little scene acquired an added poignancy\\nby reminding him--he could not have said why--of his leave-taking from\\nMadame Olenska after their confidential talk a week or ten days earlier.\\n\\nIt would have been as difficult to discover any resemblance between the\\ntwo situations as between the appearance of the persons concerned.\\nNewland Archer could not pretend to anything approaching the young\\nEnglish actor\\'s romantic good looks, and Miss Dyas was a tall\\nred-haired woman of monumental build whose pale and pleasantly ugly\\nface was utterly unlike Ellen Olenska\\'s vivid countenance.  Nor were\\nArcher and Madame Olenska two lovers parting in heart-broken silence;\\nthey were client and lawyer separating after a talk which had given the\\nlawyer the worst possible impression of the client\\'s case.  Wherein,\\nthen, lay the resemblance that made the young man\\'s heart beat with a\\nkind of retrospective excitement?  It seemed to be in Madame Olenska\\'s\\nmysterious faculty of suggesting tragic and moving possibilities\\noutside the daily run of experience.  She had hardly ever said a word\\nto him to produce this impression, but it was a part of her, either a\\nprojection of her mysterious and outlandish background or of something\\ninherently dramatic, passionate and unusual in herself.  Archer had\\nalways been inclined to think that chance and circumstance played a\\nsmall part in shaping people\\'s lots compared with their innate tendency\\nto have things happen to them.  This tendency he had felt from the\\nfirst in Madame Olenska.  The quiet, almost passive young woman struck\\nhim as exactly the kind of person to whom things were bound to happen,\\nno matter how much she shrank from them and went out of her way to\\navoid them.  The exciting fact was her having lived in an atmosphere so\\nthick with drama that her own tendency to provoke it had apparently\\npassed unperceived.  It was precisely the odd absence of surprise in\\nher that gave him the sense of her having been plucked out of a very\\nmaelstrom: the things she took for granted gave the measure of those\\nshe had rebelled against.\\n\\nArcher had left her with the conviction that Count Olenski\\'s accusation\\nwas not unfounded.  The mysterious person who figured in his wife\\'s\\npast as \"the secretary\" had probably not been unrewarded for his share\\nin her escape.  The conditions from which she had fled were\\nintolerable, past speaking of, past believing: she was young, she was\\nfrightened, she was desperate--what more natural than that she should\\nbe grateful to her rescuer?  The pity was that her gratitude put her,\\nin the law\\'s eyes and the world\\'s, on a par with her abominable\\nhusband.  Archer had made her understand this, as he was bound to do;\\nhe had also made her understand that simplehearted kindly New York, on\\nwhose larger charity she had apparently counted, was precisely the\\nplace where she could least hope for indulgence.\\n\\nTo have to make this fact plain to her--and to witness her resigned\\nacceptance of it--had been intolerably painful to him.  He felt himself\\ndrawn to her by obscure feelings of jealousy and pity, as if her\\ndumbly-confessed error had put her at his mercy, humbling yet endearing\\nher.  He was glad it was to him she had revealed her secret, rather\\nthan to the cold scrutiny of Mr. Letterblair, or the embarrassed gaze\\nof her family.  He immediately took it upon himself to assure them both\\nthat she had given up her idea of seeking a divorce, basing her\\ndecision on the fact that she had understood the uselessness of the\\nproceeding; and with infinite relief they had all turned their eyes\\nfrom the \"unpleasantness\" she had spared them.\\n\\n\"I was sure Newland would manage it,\" Mrs. Welland had said proudly of\\nher future son-in-law; and old Mrs. Mingott, who had summoned him for a\\nconfidential interview, had congratulated him on his cleverness, and\\nadded impatiently:  \"Silly goose!  I told her myself what nonsense it\\nwas.  Wanting to pass herself off as Ellen Mingott and an old maid,\\nwhen she has the luck to be a married woman and a Countess!\"\\n\\nThese incidents had made the memory of his last talk with Madame\\nOlenska so vivid to the young man that as the curtain fell on the\\nparting of the two actors his eyes filled with tears, and he stood up\\nto leave the theatre.\\n\\nIn doing so, he turned to the side of the house behind him, and saw the\\nlady of whom he was thinking seated in a box with the Beauforts,\\nLawrence Lefferts and one or two other men.  He had not spoken with her\\nalone since their evening together, and had tried to avoid being with\\nher in company; but now their eyes met, and as Mrs. Beaufort recognised\\nhim at the same time, and made her languid little gesture of\\ninvitation, it was impossible not to go into the box.\\n\\nBeaufort and Lefferts made way for him, and after a few words with Mrs.\\nBeaufort, who always preferred to look beautiful and not have to talk,\\nArcher seated himself behind Madame Olenska.  There was no one else in\\nthe box but Mr. Sillerton Jackson, who was telling Mrs. Beaufort in a\\nconfidential undertone about Mrs. Lemuel Struthers\\'s last Sunday\\nreception (where some people reported that there had been dancing).\\nUnder cover of this circumstantial narrative, to which Mrs. Beaufort\\nlistened with her perfect smile, and her head at just the right angle\\nto be seen in profile from the stalls, Madame Olenska turned and spoke\\nin a low voice.\\n\\n\"Do you think,\" she asked, glancing toward the stage, \"he will send her\\na bunch of yellow roses tomorrow morning?\"\\n\\nArcher reddened, and his heart gave a leap of surprise.  He had called\\nonly twice on Madame Olenska, and each time he had sent her a box of\\nyellow roses, and each time without a card.  She had never before made\\nany allusion to the flowers, and he supposed she had never thought of\\nhim as the sender.  Now her sudden recognition of the gift, and her\\nassociating it with the tender leave-taking on the stage, filled him\\nwith an agitated pleasure.\\n\\n\"I was thinking of that too--I was going to leave the theatre in order\\nto take the picture away with me,\" he said.\\n\\nTo his surprise her colour rose, reluctantly and duskily.  She looked\\ndown at the mother-of-pearl opera-glass in her smoothly gloved hands,\\nand said, after a pause: \"What do you do while May is away?\"\\n\\n\"I stick to my work,\" he answered, faintly annoyed by the question.\\n\\nIn obedience to a long-established habit, the Wellands had left the\\nprevious week for St. Augustine, where, out of regard for the supposed\\nsusceptibility of Mr. Welland\\'s bronchial tubes, they always spent the\\nlatter part of the winter.  Mr. Welland was a mild and silent man, with\\nno opinions but with many habits.  With these habits none might\\ninterfere; and one of them demanded that his wife and daughter should\\nalways go with him on his annual journey to the south.  To preserve an\\nunbroken domesticity was essential to his peace of mind; he would not\\nhave known where his hair-brushes were, or how to provide stamps for\\nhis letters, if Mrs. Welland had not been there to tell him.\\n\\nAs all the members of the family adored each other, and as Mr. Welland\\nwas the central object of their idolatry, it never occurred to his wife\\nand May to let him go to St. Augustine alone; and his sons, who were\\nboth in the law, and could not leave New York during the winter, always\\njoined him for Easter and travelled back with him.\\n\\nIt was impossible for Archer to discuss the necessity of May\\'s\\naccompanying her father.  The reputation of the Mingotts\\' family\\nphysician was largely based on the attack of pneumonia which Mr.\\nWelland had never had; and his insistence on St. Augustine was\\ntherefore inflexible.  Originally, it had been intended that May\\'s\\nengagement should not be announced till her return from Florida, and\\nthe fact that it had been made known sooner could not be expected to\\nalter Mr. Welland\\'s plans.  Archer would have liked to join the\\ntravellers and have a few weeks of sunshine and boating with his\\nbetrothed; but he too was bound by custom and conventions.  Little\\narduous as his professional duties were, he would have been convicted\\nof frivolity by the whole Mingott clan if he had suggested asking for a\\nholiday in mid-winter; and he accepted May\\'s departure with the\\nresignation which he perceived would have to be one of the principal\\nconstituents of married life.\\n\\nHe was conscious that Madame Olenska was looking at him under lowered\\nlids.  \"I have done what you wished--what you advised,\" she said\\nabruptly.\\n\\n\"Ah--I\\'m glad,\" he returned, embarrassed by her broaching the subject\\nat such a moment.\\n\\n\"I understand--that you were right,\" she went on a little breathlessly;\\n\"but sometimes life is difficult ...  perplexing...\"\\n\\n\"I know.\"\\n\\n\"And I wanted to tell you that I DO feel you were right; and that I\\'m\\ngrateful to you,\" she ended, lifting her opera-glass quickly to her\\neyes as the door of the box opened and Beaufort\\'s resonant voice broke\\nin on them.\\n\\nArcher stood up, and left the box and the theatre.\\n\\nOnly the day before he had received a letter from May Welland in which,\\nwith characteristic candour, she had asked him to \"be kind to Ellen\" in\\ntheir absence.  \"She likes you and admires you so much--and you know,\\nthough she doesn\\'t show it, she\\'s still very lonely and unhappy.  I\\ndon\\'t think Granny understands her, or uncle Lovell Mingott either;\\nthey really think she\\'s much worldlier and fonder of society than she\\nis.  And I can quite see that New York must seem dull to her, though\\nthe family won\\'t admit it.  I think she\\'s been used to lots of things\\nwe haven\\'t got; wonderful music, and picture shows, and\\ncelebrities--artists and authors and all the clever people you admire.\\nGranny can\\'t understand her wanting anything but lots of dinners and\\nclothes--but I can see that you\\'re almost the only person in New York\\nwho can talk to her about what she really cares for.\"\\n\\nHis wise May--how he had loved her for that letter!  But he had not\\nmeant to act on it; he was too busy, to begin with, and he did not\\ncare, as an engaged man, to play too conspicuously the part of Madame\\nOlenska\\'s champion.  He had an idea that she knew how to take care of\\nherself a good deal better than the ingenuous May imagined.  She had\\nBeaufort at her feet, Mr. van der Luyden hovering above her like a\\nprotecting deity, and any number of candidates (Lawrence Lefferts among\\nthem) waiting their opportunity in the middle distance.  Yet he never\\nsaw her, or exchanged a word with her, without feeling that, after all,\\nMay\\'s ingenuousness almost amounted to a gift of divination.  Ellen\\nOlenska was lonely and she was unhappy.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nOld-fashioned New York dined at seven, and the habit of after-dinner\\ncalls, though derided in Archer\\'s set, still generally prevailed.  As\\nthe young man strolled up Fifth Avenue from Waverley Place, the long\\nthoroughfare was deserted but for a group of carriages standing before\\nthe Reggie Chiverses\\' (where there was a dinner for the Duke), and the\\noccasional figure of an elderly gentleman in heavy overcoat and muffler\\nascending a brownstone doorstep and disappearing into a gas-lit hall.\\nThus, as Archer crossed Washington Square, he remarked that old Mr. du\\nLac was calling on his cousins the Dagonets, and turning down the\\ncorner of West Tenth Street he saw Mr. Skipworth, of his own firm,\\nobviously bound on a visit to the Miss Lannings.  A little farther up\\nFifth Avenue, Beaufort appeared on his doorstep, darkly projected\\nagainst a blaze of light, descended to his private brougham, and rolled\\naway to a mysterious and probably unmentionable destination.  It was\\nnot an Opera night, and no one was giving a party, so that Beaufort\\'s\\nouting was undoubtedly of a clandestine nature.  Archer connected it in\\nhis mind with a little house beyond Lexington Avenue in which\\nberibboned window curtains and flower-boxes had recently appeared, and\\nbefore whose newly painted door the canary-coloured brougham of Miss\\nFanny Ring was frequently seen to wait.\\n\\nBeyond the small and slippery pyramid which composed Mrs. Archer\\'s\\nworld lay the almost unmapped quarter inhabited by artists, musicians\\nand \"people who wrote.\"  These scattered fragments of humanity had\\nnever shown any desire to be amalgamated with the social structure.  In\\nspite of odd ways they were said to be, for the most part, quite\\nrespectable; but they preferred to keep to themselves.  Medora Manson,\\nin her prosperous days, had inaugurated a \"literary salon\"; but it had\\nsoon died out owing to the reluctance of the literary to frequent it.\\n\\nOthers had made the same attempt, and there was a household of\\nBlenkers--an intense and voluble mother, and three blowsy daughters who\\nimitated her--where one met Edwin Booth and Patti and William Winter,\\nand the new Shakespearian actor George Rignold, and some of the\\nmagazine editors and musical and literary critics.\\n\\nMrs. Archer and her group felt a certain timidity concerning these\\npersons.  They were odd, they were uncertain, they had things one\\ndidn\\'t know about in the background of their lives and minds.\\nLiterature and art were deeply respected in the Archer set, and Mrs.\\nArcher was always at pains to tell her children how much more agreeable\\nand cultivated society had been when it included such figures as\\nWashington Irving, Fitz-Greene Halleck and the poet of \"The Culprit\\nFay.\" The most celebrated authors of that generation had been\\n\"gentlemen\"; perhaps the unknown persons who succeeded them had\\ngentlemanly sentiments, but their origin, their appearance, their hair,\\ntheir intimacy with the stage and the Opera, made any old New York\\ncriterion inapplicable to them.\\n\\n\"When I was a girl,\" Mrs. Archer used to say, \"we knew everybody\\nbetween the Battery and Canal Street; and only the people one knew had\\ncarriages.  It was perfectly easy to place any one then; now one can\\'t\\ntell, and I prefer not to try.\"\\n\\nOnly old Catherine Mingott, with her absence of moral prejudices and\\nalmost parvenu indifference to the subtler distinctions, might have\\nbridged the abyss; but she had never opened a book or looked at a\\npicture, and cared for music only because it reminded her of gala\\nnights at the Italiens, in the days of her triumph at the Tuileries.\\nPossibly Beaufort, who was her match in daring, would have succeeded in\\nbringing about a fusion; but his grand house and silk-stockinged\\nfootmen were an obstacle to informal sociability.  Moreover, he was as\\nilliterate as old Mrs. Mingott, and considered \"fellows who wrote\" as\\nthe mere paid purveyors of rich men\\'s pleasures; and no one rich enough\\nto influence his opinion had ever questioned it.\\n\\nNewland Archer had been aware of these things ever since he could\\nremember, and had accepted them as part of the structure of his\\nuniverse.  He knew that there were societies where painters and poets\\nand novelists and men of science, and even great actors, were as sought\\nafter as Dukes; he had often pictured to himself what it would have\\nbeen to live in the intimacy of drawing-rooms dominated by the talk of\\nMerimee (whose \"Lettres a une Inconnue\" was one of his inseparables),\\nof Thackeray, Browning or William Morris.  But such things were\\ninconceivable in New York, and unsettling to think of.  Archer knew\\nmost of the \"fellows who wrote,\" the musicians and the painters: he met\\nthem at the Century, or at the little musical and theatrical clubs that\\nwere beginning to come into existence.  He enjoyed them there, and was\\nbored with them at the Blenkers\\', where they were mingled with fervid\\nand dowdy women who passed them about like captured curiosities; and\\neven after his most exciting talks with Ned Winsett he always came away\\nwith the feeling that if his world was small, so was theirs, and that\\nthe only way to enlarge either was to reach a stage of manners where\\nthey would naturally merge.\\n\\nHe was reminded of this by trying to picture the society in which the\\nCountess Olenska had lived and suffered, and also--perhaps--tasted\\nmysterious joys.  He remembered with what amusement she had told him\\nthat her grandmother Mingott and the Wellands objected to her living in\\na \"Bohemian\" quarter given over to \"people who wrote.\"  It was not the\\nperil but the poverty that her family disliked; but that shade escaped\\nher, and she supposed they considered literature compromising.\\n\\nShe herself had no fears of it, and the books scattered about her\\ndrawing-room (a part of the house in which books were usually supposed\\nto be \"out of place\"), though chiefly works of fiction, had whetted\\nArcher\\'s interest with such new names as those of Paul Bourget,\\nHuysmans, and the Goncourt brothers.  Ruminating on these things as he\\napproached her door, he was once more conscious of the curious way in\\nwhich she reversed his values, and of the need of thinking himself into\\nconditions incredibly different from any that he knew if he were to be\\nof use in her present difficulty.\\n\\n\\nNastasia opened the door, smiling mysteriously.  On the bench in the\\nhall lay a sable-lined overcoat, a folded opera hat of dull silk with a\\ngold J. B. on the lining, and a white silk muffler: there was no\\nmistaking the fact that these costly articles were the property of\\nJulius Beaufort.\\n\\nArcher was angry: so angry that he came near scribbling a word on his\\ncard and going away; then he remembered that in writing to Madame\\nOlenska he had been kept by excess of discretion from saying that he\\nwished to see her privately.  He had therefore no one but himself to\\nblame if she had opened her doors to other visitors; and he entered the\\ndrawing-room with the dogged determination to make Beaufort feel\\nhimself in the way, and to outstay him.\\n\\nThe banker stood leaning against the mantelshelf, which was draped with\\nan old embroidery held in place by brass candelabra containing church\\ncandles of yellowish wax.  He had thrust his chest out, supporting his\\nshoulders against the mantel and resting his weight on one large\\npatent-leather foot.  As Archer entered he was smiling and looking down\\non his hostess, who sat on a sofa placed at right angles to the\\nchimney.  A table banked with flowers formed a screen behind it, and\\nagainst the orchids and azaleas which the young man recognised as\\ntributes from the Beaufort hot-houses, Madame Olenska sat\\nhalf-reclined, her head propped on a hand and her wide sleeve leaving\\nthe arm bare to the elbow.\\n\\nIt was usual for ladies who received in the evenings to wear what were\\ncalled \"simple dinner dresses\": a close-fitting armour of whale-boned\\nsilk, slightly open in the neck, with lace ruffles filling in the\\ncrack, and tight sleeves with a flounce uncovering just enough wrist to\\nshow an Etruscan gold bracelet or a velvet band.  But Madame Olenska,\\nheedless of tradition, was attired in a long robe of red velvet\\nbordered about the chin and down the front with glossy black fur.\\nArcher remembered, on his last visit to Paris, seeing a portrait by the\\nnew painter, Carolus Duran, whose pictures were the sensation of the\\nSalon, in which the lady wore one of these bold sheath-like robes with\\nher chin nestling in fur.  There was something perverse and provocative\\nin the notion of fur worn in the evening in a heated drawing-room, and\\nin the combination of a muffled throat and bare arms; but the effect\\nwas undeniably pleasing.\\n\\n\"Lord love us--three whole days at Skuytercliff!\" Beaufort was saying\\nin his loud sneering voice as Archer entered.  \"You\\'d better take all\\nyour furs, and a hot-water-bottle.\"\\n\\n\"Why?  Is the house so cold?\" she asked, holding out her left hand to\\nArcher in a way mysteriously suggesting that she expected him to kiss\\nit.\\n\\n\"No; but the missus is,\" said Beaufort, nodding carelessly to the young\\nman.\\n\\n\"But I thought her so kind.  She came herself to invite me. Granny says\\nI must certainly go.\"\\n\\n\"Granny would, of course.  And I say it\\'s a shame you\\'re going to miss\\nthe little oyster supper I\\'d planned for you at Delmonico\\'s next\\nSunday, with Campanini and Scalchi and a lot of jolly people.\"\\n\\nShe looked doubtfully from the banker to Archer.\\n\\n\"Ah--that does tempt me!  Except the other evening at Mrs. Struthers\\'s\\nI\\'ve not met a single artist since I\\'ve been here.\"\\n\\n\"What kind of artists?  I know one or two painters, very good fellows,\\nthat I could bring to see you if you\\'d allow me,\" said Archer boldly.\\n\\n\"Painters?  Are there painters in New York?\" asked Beaufort, in a tone\\nimplying that there could be none since he did not buy their pictures;\\nand Madame Olenska said to Archer, with her grave smile:  \"That would\\nbe charming.  But I was really thinking of dramatic artists, singers,\\nactors, musicians.  My husband\\'s house was always full of them.\"\\n\\nShe said the words \"my husband\" as if no sinister associations were\\nconnected with them, and in a tone that seemed almost to sigh over the\\nlost delights of her married life.  Archer looked at her perplexedly,\\nwondering if it were lightness or dissimulation that enabled her to\\ntouch so easily on the past at the very moment when she was risking her\\nreputation in order to break with it.\\n\\n\"I do think,\" she went on, addressing both men, \"that the imprevu adds\\nto one\\'s enjoyment.  It\\'s perhaps a mistake to see the same people\\nevery day.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s confoundedly dull, anyhow; New York is dying of dullness,\"\\nBeaufort grumbled.  \"And when I try to liven it up for you, you go back\\non me.  Come--think better of it!  Sunday is your last chance, for\\nCampanini leaves next week for Baltimore and Philadelphia; and I\\'ve a\\nprivate room, and a Steinway, and they\\'ll sing all night for me.\"\\n\\n\"How delicious!  May I think it over, and write to you tomorrow\\nmorning?\"\\n\\nShe spoke amiably, yet with the least hint of dismissal in her voice.\\nBeaufort evidently felt it, and being unused to dismissals, stood\\nstaring at her with an obstinate line between his eyes.\\n\\n\"Why not now?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s too serious a question to decide at this late hour.\"\\n\\n\"Do you call it late?\"\\n\\nShe returned his glance coolly.  \"Yes; because I have still to talk\\nbusiness with Mr. Archer for a little while.\"\\n\\n\"Ah,\" Beaufort snapped.  There was no appeal from her tone, and with a\\nslight shrug he recovered his composure, took her hand, which he kissed\\nwith a practised air, and calling out from the threshold:  \"I say,\\nNewland, if you can persuade the Countess to stop in town of course\\nyou\\'re included in the supper,\" left the room with his heavy important\\nstep.\\n\\nFor a moment Archer fancied that Mr. Letterblair must have told her of\\nhis coming; but the irrelevance of her next remark made him change his\\nmind.\\n\\n\"You know painters, then?  You live in their milieu?\" she asked, her\\neyes full of interest.\\n\\n\"Oh, not exactly.  I don\\'t know that the arts have a milieu here, any\\nof them; they\\'re more like a very thinly settled outskirt.\"\\n\\n\"But you care for such things?\"\\n\\n\"Immensely.  When I\\'m in Paris or London I never miss an exhibition.  I\\ntry to keep up.\"\\n\\nShe looked down at the tip of the little satin boot that peeped from\\nher long draperies.\\n\\n\"I used to care immensely too: my life was full of such things.  But\\nnow I want to try not to.\"\\n\\n\"You want to try not to?\"\\n\\n\"Yes: I want to cast off all my old life, to become just like everybody\\nelse here.\"\\n\\nArcher reddened.  \"You\\'ll never be like everybody else,\" he said.\\n\\nShe raised her straight eyebrows a little.  \"Ah, don\\'t say that.  If\\nyou knew how I hate to be different!\"\\n\\nHer face had grown as sombre as a tragic mask.  She leaned forward,\\nclasping her knee in her thin hands, and looking away from him into\\nremote dark distances.\\n\\n\"I want to get away from it all,\" she insisted.\\n\\nHe waited a moment and cleared his throat.  \"I know.  Mr. Letterblair\\nhas told me.\"\\n\\n\"Ah?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s the reason I\\'ve come.  He asked me to--you see I\\'m in the firm.\"\\n\\nShe looked slightly surprised, and then her eyes brightened.  \"You mean\\nyou can manage it for me?  I can talk to you instead of Mr.\\nLetterblair?  Oh, that will be so much easier!\"\\n\\nHer tone touched him, and his confidence grew with his\\nself-satisfaction.  He perceived that she had spoken of business to\\nBeaufort simply to get rid of him; and to have routed Beaufort was\\nsomething of a triumph.\\n\\n\"I am here to talk about it,\" he repeated.\\n\\nShe sat silent, her head still propped by the arm that rested on the\\nback of the sofa.  Her face looked pale and extinguished, as if dimmed\\nby the rich red of her dress.  She struck Archer, of a sudden, as a\\npathetic and even pitiful figure.\\n\\n\"Now we\\'re coming to hard facts,\" he thought, conscious in himself of\\nthe same instinctive recoil that he had so often criticised in his\\nmother and her contemporaries.  How little practice he had had in\\ndealing with unusual situations!  Their very vocabulary was unfamiliar\\nto him, and seemed to belong to fiction and the stage.  In face of what\\nwas coming he felt as awkward and embarrassed as a boy.\\n\\nAfter a pause Madame Olenska broke out with unexpected vehemence:  \"I\\nwant to be free; I want to wipe out all the past.\"\\n\\n\"I understand that.\"\\n\\nHer face warmed.  \"Then you\\'ll help me?\"\\n\\n\"First--\" he hesitated--\"perhaps I ought to know a little more.\"\\n\\nShe seemed surprised.  \"You know about my husband--my life with him?\"\\n\\nHe made a sign of assent.\\n\\n\"Well--then--what more is there?  In this country are such things\\ntolerated?  I\\'m a Protestant--our church does not forbid divorce in\\nsuch cases.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\n\\nThey were both silent again, and Archer felt the spectre of Count\\nOlenski\\'s letter grimacing hideously between them.  The letter filled\\nonly half a page, and was just what he had described it to be in\\nspeaking of it to Mr. Letterblair: the vague charge of an angry\\nblackguard.  But how much truth was behind it?  Only Count Olenski\\'s\\nwife could tell.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve looked through the papers you gave to Mr. Letterblair,\" he said\\nat length.\\n\\n\"Well--can there be anything more abominable?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\nShe changed her position slightly, screening her eyes with her lifted\\nhand.\\n\\n\"Of course you know,\" Archer continued, \"that if your husband chooses\\nto fight the case--as he threatens to--\"\\n\\n\"Yes--?\"\\n\\n\"He can say things--things that might be unpl--might be disagreeable to\\nyou: say them publicly, so that they would get about, and harm you even\\nif--\"\\n\\n\"If--?\"\\n\\n\"I mean: no matter how unfounded they were.\"\\n\\nShe paused for a long interval; so long that, not wishing to keep his\\neyes on her shaded face, he had time to imprint on his mind the exact\\nshape of her other hand, the one on her knee, and every detail of the\\nthree rings on her fourth and fifth fingers; among which, he noticed, a\\nwedding ring did not appear.\\n\\n\"What harm could such accusations, even if he made them publicly, do me\\nhere?\"\\n\\nIt was on his lips to exclaim:  \"My poor child--far more harm than\\nanywhere else!\"  Instead, he answered, in a voice that sounded in his\\nears like Mr. Letterblair\\'s: \"New York society is a very small world\\ncompared with the one you\\'ve lived in.  And it\\'s ruled, in spite of\\nappearances, by a few people with--well, rather old-fashioned ideas.\"\\n\\nShe said nothing, and he continued:  \"Our ideas about marriage and\\ndivorce are particularly old-fashioned.  Our legislation favours\\ndivorce--our social customs don\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"Never?\"\\n\\n\"Well--not if the woman, however injured, however irreproachable, has\\nappearances in the least degree against her, has exposed herself by any\\nunconventional action to--to offensive insinuations--\"\\n\\nShe drooped her head a little lower, and he waited again, intensely\\nhoping for a flash of indignation, or at least a brief cry of denial.\\nNone came.\\n\\nA little travelling clock ticked purringly at her elbow, and a log\\nbroke in two and sent up a shower of sparks.  The whole hushed and\\nbrooding room seemed to be waiting silently with Archer.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she murmured at length, \"that\\'s what my family tell me.\"\\n\\nHe winced a little.  \"It\\'s not unnatural--\"\\n\\n\"OUR family,\" she corrected herself; and Archer coloured.  \"For you\\'ll\\nbe my cousin soon,\" she continued gently.\\n\\n\"I hope so.\"\\n\\n\"And you take their view?\"\\n\\nHe stood up at this, wandered across the room, stared with void eyes at\\none of the pictures against the old red damask, and came back\\nirresolutely to her side.  How could he say:  \"Yes, if what your\\nhusband hints is true, or if you\\'ve no way of disproving it?\"\\n\\n\"Sincerely--\" she interjected, as he was about to speak.\\n\\nHe looked down into the fire.  \"Sincerely, then--what should you gain\\nthat would compensate for the possibility--the certainty--of a lot of\\nbeastly talk?\"\\n\\n\"But my freedom--is that nothing?\"\\n\\nIt flashed across him at that instant that the charge in the letter was\\ntrue, and that she hoped to marry the partner of her guilt.  How was he\\nto tell her that, if she really cherished such a plan, the laws of the\\nState were inexorably opposed to it?  The mere suspicion that the\\nthought was in her mind made him feel harshly and impatiently toward\\nher.  \"But aren\\'t you as free as air as it is?\" he returned.  \"Who can\\ntouch you?  Mr. Letterblair tells me the financial question has been\\nsettled--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes,\" she said indifferently.\\n\\n\"Well, then: is it worth while to risk what may be infinitely\\ndisagreeable and painful?  Think of the newspapers--their vileness!\\nIt\\'s all stupid and narrow and unjust--but one can\\'t make over society.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" she acquiesced; and her tone was so faint and desolate that he\\nfelt a sudden remorse for his own hard thoughts.\\n\\n\"The individual, in such cases, is nearly always sacrificed to what is\\nsupposed to be the collective interest: people cling to any convention\\nthat keeps the family together--protects the children, if there are\\nany,\" he rambled on, pouring out all the stock phrases that rose to his\\nlips in his intense desire to cover over the ugly reality which her\\nsilence seemed to have laid bare.  Since she would not or could not say\\nthe one word that would have cleared the air, his wish was not to let\\nher feel that he was trying to probe into her secret.  Better keep on\\nthe surface, in the prudent old New York way, than risk uncovering a\\nwound he could not heal.\\n\\n\"It\\'s my business, you know,\" he went on, \"to help you to see these\\nthings as the people who are fondest of you see them.  The Mingotts,\\nthe Wellands, the van der Luydens, all your friends and relations: if I\\ndidn\\'t show you honestly how they judge such questions, it wouldn\\'t be\\nfair of me, would it?\"  He spoke insistently, almost pleading with her\\nin his eagerness to cover up that yawning silence.\\n\\nShe said slowly:  \"No; it wouldn\\'t be fair.\"\\n\\nThe fire had crumbled down to greyness, and one of the lamps made a\\ngurgling appeal for attention.  Madame Olenska rose, wound it up and\\nreturned to the fire, but without resuming her seat.\\n\\nHer remaining on her feet seemed to signify that there was nothing more\\nfor either of them to say, and Archer stood up also.\\n\\n\"Very well; I will do what you wish,\" she said abruptly.  The blood\\nrushed to his forehead; and, taken aback by the suddenness of her\\nsurrender, he caught her two hands awkwardly in his.\\n\\n\"I--I do want to help you,\" he said.\\n\\n\"You do help me.  Good night, my cousin.\"\\n\\nHe bent and laid his lips on her hands, which were cold and lifeless.\\nShe drew them away, and he turned to the door, found his coat and hat\\nunder the faint gas-light of the hall, and plunged out into the winter\\nnight bursting with the belated eloquence of the inarticulate.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nThat evening, after Mr. Jackson had taken himself away, and the ladies\\nhad retired to their chintz-curtained bedroom, Newland Archer mounted\\nthoughtfully to his own study.  A vigilant hand had, as usual, kept the\\nfire alive and the lamp trimmed; and the room, with its rows and rows\\nof books, its bronze and steel statuettes of \"The Fencers\" on the\\nmantelpiece and its many photographs of famous pictures, looked\\nsingularly home-like and welcoming.\\n\\nAs he dropped into his armchair near the fire his eyes rested on a\\nlarge photograph of May Welland, which the young girl had given him in\\nthe first days of their romance, and which had now displaced all the\\nother portraits on the table.  With a new sense of awe he looked at the\\nfrank forehead, serious eyes and gay innocent mouth of the young\\ncreature whose soul\\'s custodian he was to be.  That terrifying product\\nof the social system he belonged to and believed in, the young girl who\\nknew nothing and expected everything, looked back at him like a\\nstranger through May Welland\\'s familiar features; and once more it was\\nborne in on him that marriage was not the safe anchorage he had been\\ntaught to think, but a voyage on uncharted seas.\\n\\nThe case of the Countess Olenska had stirred up old settled convictions\\nand set them drifting dangerously through his mind.  His own\\nexclamation:  \"Women should be free--as free as we are,\" struck to the\\nroot of a problem that it was agreed in his world to regard as\\nnon-existent.  \"Nice\" women, however wronged, would never claim the\\nkind of freedom he meant, and generous-minded men like himself were\\ntherefore--in the heat of argument--the more chivalrously ready to\\nconcede it to them.  Such verbal generosities were in fact only a\\nhumbugging disguise of the inexorable conventions that tied things\\ntogether and bound people down to the old pattern.  But here he was\\npledged to defend, on the part of his betrothed\\'s cousin, conduct that,\\non his own wife\\'s part, would justify him in calling down on her all\\nthe thunders of Church and State.  Of course the dilemma was purely\\nhypothetical; since he wasn\\'t a blackguard Polish nobleman, it was\\nabsurd to speculate what his wife\\'s rights would be if he WERE.  But\\nNewland Archer was too imaginative not to feel that, in his case and\\nMay\\'s, the tie might gall for reasons far less gross and palpable.\\nWhat could he and she really know of each other, since it was his duty,\\nas a \"decent\" fellow, to conceal his past from her, and hers, as a\\nmarriageable girl, to have no past to conceal?  What if, for some one\\nof the subtler reasons that would tell with both of them, they should\\ntire of each other, misunderstand or irritate each other?  He reviewed\\nhis friends\\' marriages--the supposedly happy ones--and saw none that\\nanswered, even remotely, to the passionate and tender comradeship which\\nhe pictured as his permanent relation with May Welland.  He perceived\\nthat such a picture presupposed, on her part, the experience, the\\nversatility, the freedom of judgment, which she had been carefully\\ntrained not to possess; and with a shiver of foreboding he saw his\\nmarriage becoming what most of the other marriages about him were: a\\ndull association of material and social interests held together by\\nignorance on the one side and hypocrisy on the other.  Lawrence\\nLefferts occurred to him as the husband who had most completely\\nrealised this enviable ideal.  As became the high-priest of form, he\\nhad formed a wife so completely to his own convenience that, in the\\nmost conspicuous moments of his frequent love-affairs with other men\\'s\\nwives, she went about in smiling unconsciousness, saying that \"Lawrence\\nwas so frightfully strict\"; and had been known to blush indignantly,\\nand avert her gaze, when some one alluded in her presence to the fact\\nthat Julius Beaufort (as became a \"foreigner\" of doubtful origin) had\\nwhat was known in New York as \"another establishment.\"\\n\\nArcher tried to console himself with the thought that he was not quite\\nsuch an ass as Larry Lefferts, nor May such a simpleton as poor\\nGertrude; but the difference was after all one of intelligence and not\\nof standards.  In reality they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic\\nworld, where the real thing was never said or done or even thought, but\\nonly represented by a set of arbitrary signs; as when Mrs. Welland, who\\nknew exactly why Archer had pressed her to announce her daughter\\'s\\nengagement at the Beaufort ball (and had indeed expected him to do no\\nless), yet felt obliged to simulate reluctance, and the air of having\\nhad her hand forced, quite as, in the books on Primitive Man that\\npeople of advanced culture were beginning to read, the savage bride is\\ndragged with shrieks from her parents\\' tent.\\n\\nThe result, of course, was that the young girl who was the centre of\\nthis elaborate system of mystification remained the more inscrutable\\nfor her very frankness and assurance.  She was frank, poor darling,\\nbecause she had nothing to conceal, assured because she knew of nothing\\nto be on her guard against; and with no better preparation than this,\\nshe was to be plunged overnight into what people evasively called \"the\\nfacts of life.\"\\n\\nThe young man was sincerely but placidly in love.  He delighted in the\\nradiant good looks of his betrothed, in her health, her horsemanship,\\nher grace and quickness at games, and the shy interest in books and\\nideas that she was beginning to develop under his guidance.  (She had\\nadvanced far enough to join him in ridiculing the Idyls of the King,\\nbut not to feel the beauty of Ulysses and the Lotus Eaters.) She was\\nstraightforward, loyal and brave; she had a sense of humour (chiefly\\nproved by her laughing at HIS jokes); and he suspected, in the depths\\nof her innocently-gazing soul, a glow of feeling that it would be a joy\\nto waken.  But when he had gone the brief round of her he returned\\ndiscouraged by the thought that all this frankness and innocence were\\nonly an artificial product.  Untrained human nature was not frank and\\ninnocent; it was full of the twists and defences of an instinctive\\nguile.  And he felt himself oppressed by this creation of factitious\\npurity, so cunningly manufactured by a conspiracy of mothers and aunts\\nand grandmothers and long-dead ancestresses, because it was supposed to\\nbe what he wanted, what he had a right to, in order that he might\\nexercise his lordly pleasure in smashing it like an image made of snow.\\n\\nThere was a certain triteness in these reflections: they were those\\nhabitual to young men on the approach of their wedding day.  But they\\nwere generally accompanied by a sense of compunction and self-abasement\\nof which Newland Archer felt no trace.  He could not deplore (as\\nThackeray\\'s heroes so often exasperated him by doing) that he had not a\\nblank page to offer his bride in exchange for the unblemished one she\\nwas to give to him.  He could not get away from the fact that if he had\\nbeen brought up as she had they would have been no more fit to find\\ntheir way about than the Babes in the Wood; nor could he, for all his\\nanxious cogitations, see any honest reason (any, that is, unconnected\\nwith his own momentary pleasure, and the passion of masculine vanity)\\nwhy his bride should not have been allowed the same freedom of\\nexperience as himself.\\n\\nSuch questions, at such an hour, were bound to drift through his mind;\\nbut he was conscious that their uncomfortable persistence and precision\\nwere due to the inopportune arrival of the Countess Olenska.  Here he\\nwas, at the very moment of his betrothal--a moment for pure thoughts\\nand cloudless hopes--pitchforked into a coil of scandal which raised\\nall the special problems he would have preferred to let lie.  \"Hang\\nEllen Olenska!\" he grumbled, as he covered his fire and began to\\nundress.  He could not really see why her fate should have the least\\nbearing on his; yet he dimly felt that he had only just begun to\\nmeasure the risks of the championship which his engagement had forced\\nupon him.\\n\\n\\nA few days later the bolt fell.\\n\\nThe Lovell Mingotts had sent out cards for what was known as \"a formal\\ndinner\" (that is, three extra footmen, two dishes for each course, and\\na Roman punch in the middle), and had headed their invitations with the\\nwords \"To meet the Countess Olenska,\" in accordance with the hospitable\\nAmerican fashion, which treats strangers as if they were royalties, or\\nat least as their ambassadors.\\n\\nThe guests had been selected with a boldness and discrimination in\\nwhich the initiated recognised the firm hand of Catherine the Great.\\nAssociated with such immemorial standbys as the Selfridge Merrys, who\\nwere asked everywhere because they always had been, the Beauforts, on\\nwhom there was a claim of relationship, and Mr. Sillerton Jackson and\\nhis sister Sophy (who went wherever her brother told her to), were some\\nof the most fashionable and yet most irreproachable of the dominant\\n\"young married\" set; the Lawrence Leffertses, Mrs. Lefferts Rushworth\\n(the lovely widow), the Harry Thorleys, the Reggie Chiverses and young\\nMorris Dagonet and his wife (who was a van der Luyden).  The company\\nindeed was perfectly assorted, since all the members belonged to the\\nlittle inner group of people who, during the long New York season,\\ndisported themselves together daily and nightly with apparently\\nundiminished zest.\\n\\nForty-eight hours later the unbelievable had happened; every one had\\nrefused the Mingotts\\' invitation except the Beauforts and old Mr.\\nJackson and his sister.  The intended slight was emphasised by the fact\\nthat even the Reggie Chiverses, who were of the Mingott clan, were\\namong those inflicting it; and by the uniform wording of the notes, in\\nall of which the writers \"regretted that they were unable to accept,\"\\nwithout the mitigating plea of a \"previous engagement\" that ordinary\\ncourtesy prescribed.\\n\\nNew York society was, in those days, far too small, and too scant in\\nits resources, for every one in it (including livery-stable-keepers,\\nbutlers and cooks) not to know exactly on which evenings people were\\nfree; and it was thus possible for the recipients of Mrs. Lovell\\nMingott\\'s invitations to make cruelly clear their determination not to\\nmeet the Countess Olenska.\\n\\nThe blow was unexpected; but the Mingotts, as their way was, met it\\ngallantly.  Mrs. Lovell Mingott confided the case to Mrs. Welland, who\\nconfided it to Newland Archer; who, aflame at the outrage, appealed\\npassionately and authoritatively to his mother; who, after a painful\\nperiod of inward resistance and outward temporising, succumbed to his\\ninstances (as she always did), and immediately embracing his cause with\\nan energy redoubled by her previous hesitations, put on her grey velvet\\nbonnet and said:  \"I\\'ll go and see Louisa van der Luyden.\"\\n\\nThe New York of Newland Archer\\'s day was a small and slippery pyramid,\\nin which, as yet, hardly a fissure had been made or a foothold gained.\\nAt its base was a firm foundation of what Mrs. Archer called \"plain\\npeople\"; an honourable but obscure majority of respectable families who\\n(as in the case of the Spicers or the Leffertses or the Jacksons) had\\nbeen raised above their level by marriage with one of the ruling clans.\\nPeople, Mrs. Archer always said, were not as particular as they used to\\nbe; and with old Catherine Spicer ruling one end of Fifth Avenue, and\\nJulius Beaufort the other, you couldn\\'t expect the old traditions to\\nlast much longer.\\n\\nFirmly narrowing upward from this wealthy but inconspicuous substratum\\nwas the compact and dominant group which the Mingotts, Newlands,\\nChiverses and Mansons so actively represented.  Most people imagined\\nthem to be the very apex of the pyramid; but they themselves (at least\\nthose of Mrs. Archer\\'s generation) were aware that, in the eyes of the\\nprofessional genealogist, only a still smaller number of families could\\nlay claim to that eminence.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t tell me,\" Mrs. Archer would say to her children, \"all this\\nmodern newspaper rubbish about a New York aristocracy.  If there is\\none, neither the Mingotts nor the Mansons belong to it; no, nor the\\nNewlands or the Chiverses either.  Our grandfathers and\\ngreat-grandfathers were just respectable English or Dutch merchants,\\nwho came to the colonies to make their fortune, and stayed here because\\nthey did so well.  One of your great-grandfathers signed the\\nDeclaration, and another was a general on Washington\\'s staff, and\\nreceived General Burgoyne\\'s sword after the battle of Saratoga.  These\\nare things to be proud of, but they have nothing to do with rank or\\nclass.  New York has always been a commercial community, and there are\\nnot more than three families in it who can claim an aristocratic origin\\nin the real sense of the word.\"\\n\\nMrs. Archer and her son and daughter, like every one else in New York,\\nknew who these privileged beings were: the Dagonets of Washington\\nSquare, who came of an old English county family allied with the Pitts\\nand Foxes; the Lannings, who had intermarried with the descendants of\\nCount de Grasse, and the van der Luydens, direct descendants of the\\nfirst Dutch governor of Manhattan, and related by pre-revolutionary\\nmarriages to several members of the French and British aristocracy.\\n\\nThe Lannings survived only in the person of two very old but lively\\nMiss Lannings, who lived cheerfully and reminiscently among family\\nportraits and Chippendale; the Dagonets were a considerable clan,\\nallied to the best names in Baltimore and Philadelphia; but the van der\\nLuydens, who stood above all of them, had faded into a kind of\\nsuper-terrestrial twilight, from which only two figures impressively\\nemerged; those of Mr. and Mrs. Henry van der Luyden.\\n\\nMrs. Henry van der Luyden had been Louisa Dagonet, and her mother had\\nbeen the granddaughter of Colonel du Lac, of an old Channel Island\\nfamily, who had fought under Cornwallis and had settled in Maryland,\\nafter the war, with his bride, Lady Angelica Trevenna, fifth daughter\\nof the Earl of St. Austrey.  The tie between the Dagonets, the du Lacs\\nof Maryland, and their aristocratic Cornish kinsfolk, the Trevennas,\\nhad always remained close and cordial.  Mr. and Mrs. van der Luyden had\\nmore than once paid long visits to the present head of the house of\\nTrevenna, the Duke of St.  Austrey, at his country-seat in Cornwall and\\nat St.  Austrey in Gloucestershire; and his Grace had frequently\\nannounced his intention of some day returning their visit (without the\\nDuchess, who feared the Atlantic).\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. van der Luyden divided their time between Trevenna, their\\nplace in Maryland, and Skuytercliff, the great estate on the Hudson\\nwhich had been one of the colonial grants of the Dutch government to\\nthe famous first Governor, and of which Mr. van der Luyden was still\\n\"Patroon.\"  Their large solemn house in Madison Avenue was seldom\\nopened, and when they came to town they received in it only their most\\nintimate friends.\\n\\n\"I wish you would go with me, Newland,\" his mother said, suddenly\\npausing at the door of the Brown coupe.  \"Louisa is fond of you; and of\\ncourse it\\'s on account of dear May that I\\'m taking this step--and also\\nbecause, if we don\\'t all stand together, there\\'ll be no such thing as\\nSociety left.\"\\n\\n\\n',\n",

As was the custom in old-fashioned Episcopalian New York,\\nshe usually accompanied her parents to church on Sunday afternoons; but\\nMrs. Welland condoned her truancy, having that very morning won her\\nover to the necessity of a long engagement, with time to prepare a\\nhand-embroidered trousseau containing the proper number of dozens.\\n\\nThe day was delectable.  The bare vaulting of trees along the Mall was\\nceiled with lapis lazuli, and arched above snow that shone like\\nsplintered crystals.  It was the weather to call out May\\'s radiance,\\nand she burned like a young maple in the frost.  Archer was proud of\\nthe glances turned on her, and the simple joy of possessorship cleared\\naway his underlying perplexities.\\n\\n\"It\\'s so delicious--waking every morning to smell lilies-of-the-valley\\nin one\\'s room!\" she said.\\n\\n\"Yesterday they came late.  I hadn\\'t time in the morning--\"\\n\\n\"But your remembering each day to send them makes me love them so much\\nmore than if you\\'d given a standing order, and they came every morning\\non the minute, like one\\'s music-teacher--as I know Gertrude Lefferts\\'s\\ndid, for instance, when she and Lawrence were engaged.\"\\n\\n\"Ah--they would!\" laughed Archer, amused at her keenness.  He looked\\nsideways at her fruit-like cheek and felt rich and secure enough to\\nadd:  \"When I sent your lilies yesterday afternoon I saw some rather\\ngorgeous yellow roses and packed them off to Madame Olenska.  Was that\\nright?\"\\n\\n\"How dear of you!  Anything of that kind delights her.  It\\'s odd she\\ndidn\\'t mention it: she lunched with us today, and spoke of Mr.\\nBeaufort\\'s having sent her wonderful orchids, and cousin Henry van der\\nLuyden a whole hamper of carnations from Skuytercliff.  She seems so\\nsurprised to receive flowers.  Don\\'t people send them in Europe?  She\\nthinks it such a pretty custom.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, well, no wonder mine were overshadowed by Beaufort\\'s,\" said Archer\\nirritably.  Then he remembered that he had not put a card with the\\nroses, and was vexed at having spoken of them.  He wanted to say:  \"I\\ncalled on your cousin yesterday,\" but hesitated.  If Madame Olenska had\\nnot spoken of his visit it might seem awkward that he should.  Yet not\\nto do so gave the affair an air of mystery that he disliked.  To shake\\noff the question he began to talk of their own plans, their future, and\\nMrs. Welland\\'s insistence on a long engagement.\\n\\n\"If you call it long!  Isabel Chivers and Reggie were engaged for two\\nyears: Grace and Thorley for nearly a year and a half.  Why aren\\'t we\\nvery well off as we are?\"\\n\\nIt was the traditional maidenly interrogation, and he felt ashamed of\\nhimself for finding it singularly childish.  No doubt she simply echoed\\nwhat was said for her; but she was nearing her twenty-second birthday,\\nand he wondered at what age \"nice\" women began to speak for themselves.\\n\\n\"Never, if we won\\'t let them, I suppose,\" he mused, and recalled his\\nmad outburst to Mr. Sillerton Jackson: \"Women ought to be as free as we\\nare--\"\\n\\nIt would presently be his task to take the bandage from this young\\nwoman\\'s eyes, and bid her look forth on the world.  But how many\\ngenerations of the women who had gone to her making had descended\\nbandaged to the family vault?  He shivered a little, remembering some\\nof the new ideas in his scientific books, and the much-cited instance\\nof the Kentucky cave-fish, which had ceased to develop eyes because\\nthey had no use for them.  What if, when he had bidden May Welland to\\nopen hers, they could only look out blankly at blankness?\\n\\n\"We might be much better off.  We might be altogether together--we\\nmight travel.\"\\n\\nHer face lit up.  \"That would be lovely,\" she owned: she would love to\\ntravel.  But her mother would not understand their wanting to do things\\nso differently.\\n\\n\"As if the mere \\'differently\\' didn\\'t account for it!\" the wooer\\ninsisted.\\n\\n\"Newland!  You\\'re so original!\" she exulted.\\n\\nHis heart sank, for he saw that he was saying all the things that young\\nmen in the same situation were expected to say, and that she was making\\nthe answers that instinct and tradition taught her to make--even to the\\npoint of calling him original.\\n\\n\"Original!  We\\'re all as like each other as those dolls cut out of the\\nsame folded paper.  We\\'re like patterns stencilled on a wall.  Can\\'t\\nyou and I strike out for ourselves, May?\"\\n\\nHe had stopped and faced her in the excitement of their discussion, and\\nher eyes rested on him with a bright unclouded admiration.\\n\\n\"Mercy--shall we elope?\" she laughed.\\n\\n\"If you would--\"\\n\\n\"You DO love me, Newland!  I\\'m so happy.\"\\n\\n\"But then--why not be happier?\"\\n\\n\"We can\\'t behave like people in novels, though, can we?\"\\n\\n\"Why not--why not--why not?\"\\n\\nShe looked a little bored by his insistence.  She knew very well that\\nthey couldn\\'t, but it was troublesome to have to produce a reason.\\n\"I\\'m not clever enough to argue with you.  But that kind of thing is\\nrather--vulgar, isn\\'t it?\" she suggested, relieved to have hit on a\\nword that would assuredly extinguish the whole subject.\\n\\n\"Are you so much afraid, then, of being vulgar?\"\\n\\nShe was evidently staggered by this.  \"Of course I should hate it--so\\nwould you,\" she rejoined, a trifle irritably.\\n\\nHe stood silent, beating his stick nervously against his boot-top; and\\nfeeling that she had indeed found the right way of closing the\\ndiscussion, she went on light-heartedly: \"Oh, did I tell you that I\\nshowed Ellen my ring?  She thinks it the most beautiful setting she\\never saw.  There\\'s nothing like it in the rue de la Paix, she said.  I\\ndo love you, Newland, for being so artistic!\"\\n\\n\\nThe next afternoon, as Archer, before dinner, sat smoking sullenly in\\nhis study, Janey wandered in on him.  He had failed to stop at his club\\non the way up from the office where he exercised the profession of the\\nlaw in the leisurely manner common to well-to-do New Yorkers of his\\nclass.  He was out of spirits and slightly out of temper, and a\\nhaunting horror of doing the same thing every day at the same hour\\nbesieged his brain.\\n\\n\"Sameness--sameness!\" he muttered, the word running through his head\\nlike a persecuting tune as he saw the familiar tall-hatted figures\\nlounging behind the plate-glass; and because he usually dropped in at\\nthe club at that hour he had gone home instead.  He knew not only what\\nthey were likely to be talking about, but the part each one would take\\nin the discussion.  The Duke of course would be their principal theme;\\nthough the appearance in Fifth Avenue of a golden-haired lady in a\\nsmall canary-coloured brougham with a pair of black cobs (for which\\nBeaufort was generally thought responsible) would also doubtless be\\nthoroughly gone into.  Such \"women\" (as they were called) were few in\\nNew York, those driving their own carriages still fewer, and the\\nappearance of Miss Fanny Ring in Fifth Avenue at the fashionable hour\\nhad profoundly agitated society.  Only the day before, her carriage had\\npassed Mrs. Lovell Mingott\\'s, and the latter had instantly rung the\\nlittle bell at her elbow and ordered the coachman to drive her home.\\n\"What if it had happened to Mrs. van der Luyden?\" people asked each\\nother with a shudder.  Archer could hear Lawrence Lefferts, at that\\nvery hour, holding forth on the disintegration of society.\\n\\nHe raised his head irritably when his sister Janey entered, and then\\nquickly bent over his book (Swinburne\\'s \"Chastelard\"--just out) as if\\nhe had not seen her.  She glanced at the writing-table heaped with\\nbooks, opened a volume of the \"Contes Drolatiques,\" made a wry face\\nover the archaic French, and sighed:  \"What learned things you read!\"\\n\\n\"Well--?\" he asked, as she hovered Cassandra-like before him.\\n\\n\"Mother\\'s very angry.\"\\n\\n\"Angry?  With whom?  About what?\"\\n\\n\"Miss Sophy Jackson has just been here.  She brought word that her\\nbrother would come in after dinner: she couldn\\'t say very much, because\\nhe forbade her to: he wishes to give all the details himself.  He\\'s\\nwith cousin Louisa van der Luyden now.\"\\n\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, my dear girl, try a fresh start.  It would take an\\nomniscient Deity to know what you\\'re talking about.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not a time to be profane, Newland....  Mother feels badly enough\\nabout your not going to church ...\"\\n\\nWith a groan he plunged back into his book.\\n\\n\"NEWLAND!  Do listen.  Your friend Madame Olenska was at Mrs. Lemuel\\nStruthers\\'s party last night: she went there with the Duke and Mr.\\nBeaufort.\"\\n\\nAt the last clause of this announcement a senseless anger swelled the\\nyoung man\\'s breast.  To smother it he laughed.  \"Well, what of it?  I\\nknew she meant to.\"\\n\\nJaney paled and her eyes began to project.  \"You knew she meant to--and\\nyou didn\\'t try to stop her?  To warn her?\"\\n\\n\"Stop her?  Warn her?\"  He laughed again.  \"I\\'m not engaged to be\\nmarried to the Countess Olenska!\"  The words had a fantastic sound in\\nhis own ears.\\n\\n\"You\\'re marrying into her family.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, family--family!\" he jeered.\\n\\n\"Newland--don\\'t you care about Family?\"\\n\\n\"Not a brass farthing.\"\\n\\n\"Nor about what cousin Louisa van der Luyden will think?\"\\n\\n\"Not the half of one--if she thinks such old maid\\'s rubbish.\"\\n\\n\"Mother is not an old maid,\" said his virgin sister with pinched lips.\\n\\nHe felt like shouting back:  \"Yes, she is, and so are the van der\\nLuydens, and so we all are, when it comes to being so much as brushed\\nby the wing-tip of Reality.\" But he saw her long gentle face puckering\\ninto tears, and felt ashamed of the useless pain he was inflicting.\\n\\n\"Hang Countess Olenska!  Don\\'t be a goose, Janey--I\\'m not her keeper.\"\\n\\n\"No; but you DID ask the Wellands to announce your engagement sooner so\\nthat we might all back her up; and if it hadn\\'t been for that cousin\\nLouisa would never have invited her to the dinner for the Duke.\"\\n\\n\"Well--what harm was there in inviting her?  She was the best-looking\\nwoman in the room; she made the dinner a little less funereal than the\\nusual van der Luyden banquet.\"\\n\\n\"You know cousin Henry asked her to please you: he persuaded cousin\\nLouisa.  And now they\\'re so upset that they\\'re going back to\\nSkuytercliff tomorrow.  I think, Newland, you\\'d better come down.  You\\ndon\\'t seem to understand how mother feels.\"\\n\\nIn the drawing-room Newland found his mother.  She raised a troubled\\nbrow from her needlework to ask: \"Has Janey told you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"  He tried to keep his tone as measured as her own.  \"But I can\\'t\\ntake it very seriously.\"\\n\\n\"Not the fact of having offended cousin Louisa and cousin Henry?\"\\n\\n\"The fact that they can be offended by such a trifle as Countess\\nOlenska\\'s going to the house of a woman they consider common.\"\\n\\n\"Consider--!\"\\n\\n\"Well, who is; but who has good music, and amuses people on Sunday\\nevenings, when the whole of New York is dying of inanition.\"\\n\\n\"Good music?  All I know is, there was a woman who got up on a table\\nand sang the things they sing at the places you go to in Paris.  There\\nwas smoking and champagne.\"\\n\\n\"Well--that kind of thing happens in other places, and the world still\\ngoes on.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t suppose, dear, you\\'re really defending the French Sunday?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve heard you often enough, mother, grumble at the English Sunday\\nwhen we\\'ve been in London.\"\\n\\n\"New York is neither Paris nor London.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, it\\'s not!\" her son groaned.\\n\\n\"You mean, I suppose, that society here is not as brilliant?  You\\'re\\nright, I daresay; but we belong here, and people should respect our\\nways when they come among us.  Ellen Olenska especially: she came back\\nto get away from the kind of life people lead in brilliant societies.\"\\n\\nNewland made no answer, and after a moment his mother ventured:  \"I was\\ngoing to put on my bonnet and ask you to take me to see cousin Louisa\\nfor a moment before dinner.\"  He frowned, and she continued: \"I thought\\nyou might explain to her what you\\'ve just said: that society abroad is\\ndifferent ... that people are not as particular, and that Madame\\nOlenska may not have realised how we feel about such things.  It would\\nbe, you know, dear,\" she added with an innocent adroitness, \"in Madame\\nOlenska\\'s interest if you did.\"\\n\\n\"Dearest mother, I really don\\'t see how we\\'re concerned in the matter.\\nThe Duke took Madame Olenska to Mrs. Struthers\\'s--in fact he brought\\nMrs. Struthers to call on her.  I was there when they came.  If the van\\nder Luydens want to quarrel with anybody, the real culprit is under\\ntheir own roof.\"\\n\\n\"Quarrel?  Newland, did you ever know of cousin Henry\\'s quarrelling?\\nBesides, the Duke\\'s his guest; and a stranger too.  Strangers don\\'t\\ndiscriminate: how should they?  Countess Olenska is a New Yorker, and\\nshould have respected the feelings of New York.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, if they must have a victim, you have my leave to throw\\nMadame Olenska to them,\" cried her son, exasperated.  \"I don\\'t see\\nmyself--or you either--offering ourselves up to expiate her crimes.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, of course you see only the Mingott side,\" his mother answered, in\\nthe sensitive tone that was her nearest approach to anger.\\n\\nThe sad butler drew back the drawing-room portieres and announced:\\n\"Mr. Henry van der Luyden.\"\\n\\nMrs. Archer dropped her needle and pushed her chair back with an\\nagitated hand.\\n\\n\"Another lamp,\" she cried to the retreating servant, while Janey bent\\nover to straighten her mother\\'s cap.\\n\\nMr. van der Luyden\\'s figure loomed on the threshold, and Newland Archer\\nwent forward to greet his cousin.\\n\\n\"We were just talking about you, sir,\" he said.\\n\\nMr. van der Luyden seemed overwhelmed by the announcement.  He drew off\\nhis glove to shake hands with the ladies, and smoothed his tall hat\\nshyly, while Janey pushed an arm-chair forward, and Archer continued:\\n\"And the Countess Olenska.\"\\n\\nMrs. Archer paled.\\n\\n\"Ah--a charming woman.  I have just been to see her,\" said Mr. van der\\nLuyden, complacency restored to his brow.  He sank into the chair, laid\\nhis hat and gloves on the floor beside him in the old-fashioned way,\\nand went on:  \"She has a real gift for arranging flowers.  I had sent\\nher a few carnations from Skuytercliff, and I was astonished.  Instead\\nof massing them in big bunches as our head-gardener does, she had\\nscattered them about loosely, here and there ... I can\\'t say how.  The\\nDuke had told me: he said:  \\'Go and see how cleverly she\\'s arranged her\\ndrawing-room.\\'  And she has.  I should really like to take Louisa to\\nsee her, if the neighbourhood were not so--unpleasant.\"\\n\\nA dead silence greeted this unusual flow of words from Mr. van der\\nLuyden.  Mrs. Archer drew her embroidery out of the basket into which\\nshe had nervously tumbled it, and Newland, leaning against the\\nchimney-place and twisting a humming-bird-feather screen in his hand,\\nsaw Janey\\'s gaping countenance lit up by the coming of the second lamp.\\n\\n\"The fact is,\" Mr. van der Luyden continued, stroking his long grey leg\\nwith a bloodless hand weighed down by the Patroon\\'s great signet-ring,\\n\"the fact is, I dropped in to thank her for the very pretty note she\\nwrote me about my flowers; and also--but this is between ourselves, of\\ncourse--to give her a friendly warning about allowing the Duke to carry\\nher off to parties with him.  I don\\'t know if you\\'ve heard--\"\\n\\nMrs. Archer produced an indulgent smile.  \"Has the Duke been carrying\\nher off to parties?\"\\n\\n\"You know what these English grandees are.  They\\'re all alike.  Louisa\\nand I are very fond of our cousin--but it\\'s hopeless to expect people\\nwho are accustomed to the European courts to trouble themselves about\\nour little republican distinctions.  The Duke goes where he\\'s amused.\"\\nMr. van der Luyden paused, but no one spoke.  \"Yes--it seems he took\\nher with him last night to Mrs. Lemuel Struthers\\'s.  Sillerton Jackson\\nhas just been to us with the foolish story, and Louisa was rather\\ntroubled.  So I thought the shortest way was to go straight to Countess\\nOlenska and explain--by the merest hint, you know--how we feel in New\\nYork about certain things.  I felt I might, without indelicacy, because\\nthe evening she dined with us she rather suggested ... rather let me\\nsee that she would be grateful for guidance.  And she WAS.\"\\n\\nMr. van der Luyden looked about the room with what would have been\\nself-satisfaction on features less purged of the vulgar passions.  On\\nhis face it became a mild benevolence which Mrs. Archer\\'s countenance\\ndutifully reflected.\\n\\n\"How kind you both are, dear Henry--always!  Newland will particularly\\nappreciate what you have done because of dear May and his new\\nrelations.\"\\n\\nShe shot an admonitory glance at her son, who said: \"Immensely, sir.\\nBut I was sure you\\'d like Madame Olenska.\"\\n\\nMr. van der Luyden looked at him with extreme gentleness.  \"I never ask\\nto my house, my dear Newland,\" he said, \"any one whom I do not like.\\nAnd so I have just told Sillerton Jackson.\"  With a glance at the clock\\nhe rose and added:  \"But Louisa will be waiting.  We are dining early,\\nto take the Duke to the Opera.\"\\n\\nAfter the portieres had solemnly closed behind their visitor a silence\\nfell upon the Archer family.\\n\\n\"Gracious--how romantic!\" at last broke explosively from Janey.  No one\\nknew exactly what inspired her elliptic comments, and her relations had\\nlong since given up trying to interpret them.\\n\\nMrs. Archer shook her head with a sigh.  \"Provided it all turns out for\\nthe best,\" she said, in the tone of one who knows how surely it will\\nnot.  \"Newland, you must stay and see Sillerton Jackson when he comes\\nthis evening: I really shan\\'t know what to say to him.\"\\n\\n\"Poor mother!  But he won\\'t come--\" her son laughed, stooping to kiss\\naway her frown.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nWall Street, the next day, had more reassuring reports of Beaufort\\'s\\nsituation.  They were not definite, but they were hopeful.  It was\\ngenerally understood that he could call on powerful influences in case\\nof emergency, and that he had done so with success; and that evening,\\nwhen Mrs. Beaufort appeared at the Opera wearing her old smile and a\\nnew emerald necklace, society drew a breath of relief.\\n\\nNew York was inexorable in its condemnation of business irregularities.\\nSo far there had been no exception to its tacit rule that those who\\nbroke the law of probity must pay; and every one was aware that even\\nBeaufort and Beaufort\\'s wife would be offered up unflinchingly to this\\nprinciple.  But to be obliged to offer them up would be not only\\npainful but inconvenient.  The disappearance of the Beauforts would\\nleave a considerable void in their compact little circle; and those who\\nwere too ignorant or too careless to shudder at the moral catastrophe\\nbewailed in advance the loss of the best ball-room in New York.\\n\\nArcher had definitely made up his mind to go to Washington.  He was\\nwaiting only for the opening of the law-suit of which he had spoken to\\nMay, so that its date might coincide with that of his visit; but on the\\nfollowing Tuesday he learned from Mr. Letterblair that the case might\\nbe postponed for several weeks.  Nevertheless, he went home that\\nafternoon determined in any event to leave the next evening.  The\\nchances were that May, who knew nothing of his professional life, and\\nhad never shown any interest in it, would not learn of the\\npostponement, should it take place, nor remember the names of the\\nlitigants if they were mentioned before her; and at any rate he could\\nno longer put off seeing Madame Olenska.  There were too many things\\nthat he must say to her.\\n\\nOn the Wednesday morning, when he reached his office, Mr. Letterblair\\nmet him with a troubled face.  Beaufort, after all, had not managed to\\n\"tide over\"; but by setting afloat the rumour that he had done so he\\nhad reassured his depositors, and heavy payments had poured into the\\nbank till the previous evening, when disturbing reports again began to\\npredominate.  In consequence, a run on the bank had begun, and its\\ndoors were likely to close before the day was over.  The ugliest things\\nwere being said of Beaufort\\'s dastardly manoeuvre, and his failure\\npromised to be one of the most discreditable in the history of Wall\\nStreet.\\n\\nThe extent of the calamity left Mr. Letterblair white and\\nincapacitated.  \"I\\'ve seen bad things in my time; but nothing as bad as\\nthis.  Everybody we know will be hit, one way or another.  And what\\nwill be done about Mrs. Beaufort?  What CAN be done about her?  I pity\\nMrs. Manson Mingott as much as anybody: coming at her age, there\\'s no\\nknowing what effect this affair may have on her.  She always believed\\nin Beaufort--she made a friend of him!  And there\\'s the whole Dallas\\nconnection: poor Mrs. Beaufort is related to every one of you.  Her\\nonly chance would be to leave her husband--yet how can any one tell her\\nso?  Her duty is at his side; and luckily she seems always to have been\\nblind to his private weaknesses.\"\\n\\nThere was a knock, and Mr. Letterblair turned his head sharply.  \"What\\nis it?  I can\\'t be disturbed.\"\\n\\nA clerk brought in a letter for Archer and withdrew.  Recognising his\\nwife\\'s hand, the young man opened the envelope and read:  \"Won\\'t you\\nplease come up town as early as you can?  Granny had a slight stroke\\nlast night.  In some mysterious way she found out before any one else\\nthis awful news about the bank.  Uncle Lovell is away shooting, and the\\nidea of the disgrace has made poor Papa so nervous that he has a\\ntemperature and can\\'t leave his room.  Mamma needs you dreadfully, and\\nI do hope you can get away at once and go straight to Granny\\'s.\"\\n\\nArcher handed the note to his senior partner, and a few minutes later\\nwas crawling northward in a crowded horse-car, which he exchanged at\\nFourteenth Street for one of the high staggering omnibuses of the Fifth\\nAvenue line.  It was after twelve o\\'clock when this laborious vehicle\\ndropped him at old Catherine\\'s.  The sitting-room window on the ground\\nfloor, where she usually throned, was tenanted by the inadequate figure\\nof her daughter, Mrs. Welland, who signed a haggard welcome as she\\ncaught sight of Archer; and at the door he was met by May.  The hall\\nwore the unnatural appearance peculiar to well-kept houses suddenly\\ninvaded by illness: wraps and furs lay in heaps on the chairs, a\\ndoctor\\'s bag and overcoat were on the table, and beside them letters\\nand cards had already piled up unheeded.\\n\\nMay looked pale but smiling: Dr. Bencomb, who had just come for the\\nsecond time, took a more hopeful view, and Mrs. Mingott\\'s dauntless\\ndetermination to live and get well was already having an effect on her\\nfamily.  May led Archer into the old lady\\'s sitting-room, where the\\nsliding doors opening into the bedroom had been drawn shut, and the\\nheavy yellow damask portieres dropped over them; and here Mrs. Welland\\ncommunicated to him in horrified undertones the details of the\\ncatastrophe.  It appeared that the evening before something dreadful\\nand mysterious had happened.  At about eight o\\'clock, just after Mrs.\\nMingott had finished the game of solitaire that she always played after\\ndinner, the door-bell had rung, and a lady so thickly veiled that the\\nservants did not immediately recognise her had asked to be received.\\n\\nThe butler, hearing a familiar voice, had thrown open the sitting-room\\ndoor, announcing:  \"Mrs. Julius Beaufort\"--and had then closed it again\\non the two ladies.  They must have been together, he thought, about an\\nhour.  When Mrs. Mingott\\'s bell rang Mrs. Beaufort had already slipped\\naway unseen, and the old lady, white and vast and terrible, sat alone\\nin her great chair, and signed to the butler to help her into her room.\\nShe seemed, at that time, though obviously distressed, in complete\\ncontrol of her body and brain.  The mulatto maid put her to bed,\\nbrought her a cup of tea as usual, laid everything straight in the\\nroom, and went away; but at three in the morning the bell rang again,\\nand the two servants, hastening in at this unwonted summons (for old\\nCatherine usually slept like a baby), had found their mistress sitting\\nup against her pillows with a crooked smile on her face and one little\\nhand hanging limp from its huge arm.\\n\\nThe stroke had clearly been a slight one, for she was able to\\narticulate and to make her wishes known; and soon after the doctor\\'s\\nfirst visit she had begun to regain control of her facial muscles.  But\\nthe alarm had been great; and proportionately great was the indignation\\nwhen it was gathered from Mrs. Mingott\\'s fragmentary phrases that\\nRegina Beaufort had come to ask her--incredible effrontery!--to back up\\nher husband, see them through--not to \"desert\" them, as she called\\nit--in fact to induce the whole family to cover and condone their\\nmonstrous dishonour.\\n\\n\"I said to her:  \\'Honour\\'s always been honour, and honesty honesty, in\\nManson Mingott\\'s house, and will be till I\\'m carried out of it feet\\nfirst,\\'\" the old woman had stammered into her daughter\\'s ear, in the\\nthick voice of the partly paralysed.  \"And when she said:  \\'But my\\nname, Auntie--my name\\'s Regina Dallas,\\' I said:  \\'It was Beaufort when\\nhe covered you with jewels, and it\\'s got to stay Beaufort now that he\\'s\\ncovered you with shame.\\'\"\\n\\nSo much, with tears and gasps of horror, Mrs. Welland imparted,\\nblanched and demolished by the unwonted obligation of having at last to\\nfix her eyes on the unpleasant and the discreditable.  \"If only I could\\nkeep it from your father-in-law: he always says: \\'Augusta, for pity\\'s\\nsake, don\\'t destroy my last illusions\\'--and how am I to prevent his\\nknowing these horrors?\" the poor lady wailed.\\n\\n\"After all, Mamma, he won\\'t have SEEN them,\" her daughter suggested;\\nand Mrs. Welland sighed:  \"Ah, no; thank heaven he\\'s safe in bed.  And\\nDr. Bencomb has promised to keep him there till poor Mamma is better,\\nand Regina has been got away somewhere.\"\\n\\nArcher had seated himself near the window and was gazing out blankly at\\nthe deserted thoroughfare.  It was evident that he had been summoned\\nrather for the moral support of the stricken ladies than because of any\\nspecific aid that he could render.  Mr. Lovell Mingott had been\\ntelegraphed for, and messages were being despatched by hand to the\\nmembers of the family living in New York; and meanwhile there was\\nnothing to do but to discuss in hushed tones the consequences of\\nBeaufort\\'s dishonour and of his wife\\'s unjustifiable action.\\n\\nMrs. Lovell Mingott, who had been in another room writing notes,\\npresently reappeared, and added her voice to the discussion.  In THEIR\\nday, the elder ladies agreed, the wife of a man who had done anything\\ndisgraceful in business had only one idea: to efface herself, to\\ndisappear with him.  \"There was the case of poor Grandmamma Spicer;\\nyour great-grandmother, May.  Of course,\" Mrs. Welland hastened to add,\\n\"your great-grandfather\\'s money difficulties were private--losses at\\ncards, or signing a note for somebody--I never quite knew, because\\nMamma would never speak of it.  But she was brought up in the country\\nbecause her mother had to leave New York after the disgrace, whatever\\nit was: they lived up the Hudson alone, winter and summer, till Mamma\\nwas sixteen.  It would never have occurred to Grandmamma Spicer to ask\\nthe family to \\'countenance\\' her, as I understand Regina calls it;\\nthough a private disgrace is nothing compared to the scandal of ruining\\nhundreds of innocent people.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it would be more becoming in Regina to hide her own countenance\\nthan to talk about other people\\'s,\" Mrs. Lovell Mingott agreed.  \"I\\nunderstand that the emerald necklace she wore at the Opera last Friday\\nhad been sent on approval from Ball and Black\\'s in the afternoon.  I\\nwonder if they\\'ll ever get it back?\"\\n\\nArcher listened unmoved to the relentless chorus.  The idea of absolute\\nfinancial probity as the first law of a gentleman\\'s code was too deeply\\ningrained in him for sentimental considerations to weaken it.  An\\nadventurer like Lemuel Struthers might build up the millions of his\\nShoe Polish on any number of shady dealings; but unblemished honesty\\nwas the noblesse oblige of old financial New York.  Nor did Mrs.\\nBeaufort\\'s fate greatly move Archer.  He felt, no doubt, more sorry for\\nher than her indignant relatives; but it seemed to him that the tie\\nbetween husband and wife, even if breakable in prosperity, should be\\nindissoluble in misfortune.  As Mr. Letterblair had said, a wife\\'s\\nplace was at her husband\\'s side when he was in trouble; but society\\'s\\nplace was not at his side, and Mrs. Beaufort\\'s cool assumption that it\\nwas seemed almost to make her his accomplice.  The mere idea of a\\nwoman\\'s appealing to her family to screen her husband\\'s business\\ndishonour was inadmissible, since it was the one thing that the Family,\\nas an institution, could not do.\\n\\nThe mulatto maid called Mrs. Lovell Mingott into the hall, and the\\nlatter came back in a moment with a frowning brow.\\n\\n\"She wants me to telegraph for Ellen Olenska.  I had written to Ellen,\\nof course, and to Medora; but now it seems that\\'s not enough.  I\\'m to\\ntelegraph to her immediately, and to tell her that she\\'s to come alone.\"\\n\\nThe announcement was received in silence.  Mrs. Welland sighed\\nresignedly, and May rose from her seat and went to gather up some\\nnewspapers that had been scattered on the floor.\\n\\n\"I suppose it must be done,\" Mrs. Lovell Mingott continued, as if\\nhoping to be contradicted; and May turned back toward the middle of the\\nroom.\\n\\n\"Of course it must be done,\" she said.  \"Granny knows what she wants,\\nand we must carry out all her wishes.  Shall I write the telegram for\\nyou, Auntie?  If it goes at once Ellen can probably catch tomorrow\\nmorning\\'s train.\"  She pronounced the syllables of the name with a\\npeculiar clearness, as if she had tapped on two silver bells.\\n\\n\"Well, it can\\'t go at once.  Jasper and the pantry-boy are both out\\nwith notes and telegrams.\"\\n\\nMay turned to her husband with a smile.  \"But here\\'s Newland, ready to\\ndo anything.  Will you take the telegram, Newland?  There\\'ll be just\\ntime before luncheon.\"\\n\\nArcher rose with a murmur of readiness, and she seated herself at old\\nCatherine\\'s rosewood \"Bonheur du Jour,\" and wrote out the message in\\nher large immature hand.  When it was written she blotted it neatly and\\nhanded it to Archer.\\n\\n\"What a pity,\" she said, \"that you and Ellen will cross each other on\\nthe way!--Newland,\" she added, turning to her mother and aunt, \"is\\nobliged to go to Washington about a patent law-suit that is coming up\\nbefore the Supreme Court.  I suppose Uncle Lovell will be back by\\ntomorrow night, and with Granny improving so much it doesn\\'t seem right\\nto ask Newland to give up an important engagement for the firm--does\\nit?\"\\n\\nShe paused, as if for an answer, and Mrs. Welland hastily declared:\\n\"Oh, of course not, darling.  Your Granny would be the last person to\\nwish it.\"  As Archer left the room with the telegram, he heard his\\nmother-in-law add, presumably to Mrs. Lovell Mingott:  \"But why on\\nearth she should make you telegraph for Ellen Olenska--\" and May\\'s\\nclear voice rejoin:  \"Perhaps it\\'s to urge on her again that after all\\nher duty is with her husband.\"\\n\\nThe outer door closed on Archer and he walked hastily away toward the\\ntelegraph office.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I\\'ve just heard of old\\nMrs. Mingott\\'s stroke; and as I was on my way to the house I saw you\\nturning down this street and nipped after you.  I suppose you\\'ve come\\nfrom there?\"\\n\\nArcher nodded, and pushed his telegram under the lattice.\\n\\n\"Very bad, eh?\" Lefferts continued.  \"Wiring to the family, I suppose.\\nI gather it IS bad, if you\\'re including Countess Olenska.\"\\n\\nArcher\\'s lips stiffened; he felt a savage impulse to dash his fist into\\nthe long vain handsome face at his side.\\n\\n\"Why?\" he questioned.\\n\\nLefferts, who was known to shrink from discussion, raised his eye-brows\\nwith an ironic grimace that warned the other of the watching damsel\\nbehind the lattice.  Nothing could be worse \"form\" the look reminded\\nArcher, than any display of temper in a public place.\\n\\nArcher had never been more indifferent to the requirements of form; but\\nhis impulse to do Lawrence Lefferts a physical injury was only\\nmomentary.  The idea of bandying Ellen Olenska\\'s name with him at such\\na time, and on whatsoever provocation, was unthinkable.  He paid for\\nhis telegram, and the two young men went out together into the street.\\nThere Archer, having regained his self-control, went on:  \"Mrs. Mingott\\nis much better: the doctor feels no anxiety whatever\"; and Lefferts,\\nwith profuse expressions of relief, asked him if he had heard that\\nthere were beastly bad rumours again about Beaufort....\\n\\nThat afternoon the announcement of the Beaufort failure was in all the\\npapers.  It overshadowed the report of Mrs. Manson Mingott\\'s stroke,\\nand only the few who had heard of the mysterious connection between the\\ntwo events thought of ascribing old Catherine\\'s illness to anything but\\nthe accumulation of flesh and years.\\n\\nThe whole of New York was darkened by the tale of Beaufort\\'s dishonour.\\nThere had never, as Mr. Letterblair said, been a worse case in his\\nmemory, nor, for that matter, in the memory of the far-off Letterblair\\nwho had given his name to the firm.  The bank had continued to take in\\nmoney for a whole day after its failure was inevitable; and as many of\\nits clients belonged to one or another of the ruling clans, Beaufort\\'s\\nduplicity seemed doubly cynical.  If Mrs. Beaufort had not taken the\\ntone that such misfortunes (the word was her own) were \"the test of\\nfriendship,\" compassion for her might have tempered the general\\nindignation against her husband.  As it was--and especially after the\\nobject of her nocturnal visit to Mrs. Manson Mingott had become\\nknown--her cynicism was held to exceed his; and she had not the\\nexcuse--nor her detractors the satisfaction--of pleading that she was\\n\"a foreigner.\"  It was some comfort (to those whose securities were not\\nin jeopardy) to be able to remind themselves that Beaufort WAS; but,\\nafter all, if a Dallas of South Carolina took his view of the case, and\\nglibly talked of his soon being \"on his feet again,\" the argument lost\\nits edge, and there was nothing to do but to accept this awful evidence\\nof the indissolubility of marriage.  Society must manage to get on\\nwithout the Beauforts, and there was an end of it--except indeed for\\nsuch hapless victims of the disaster as Medora Manson, the poor old\\nMiss Lannings, and certain other misguided ladies of good family who,\\nif only they had listened to Mr. Henry van der Luyden ...\\n\\n\"The best thing the Beauforts can do,\" said Mrs. Archer, summing it up\\nas if she were pronouncing a diagnosis and prescribing a course of\\ntreatment, \"is to go and live at Regina\\'s little place in North\\nCarolina.  Beaufort has always kept a racing stable, and he had better\\nbreed trotting horses.  I should say he had all the qualities of a\\nsuccessful horsedealer.\"  Every one agreed with her, but no one\\ncondescended to enquire what the Beauforts really meant to do.\\n\\nThe next day Mrs. Manson Mingott was much better: she recovered her\\nvoice sufficiently to give orders that no one should mention the\\nBeauforts to her again, and asked--when Dr. Bencomb appeared--what in\\nthe world her family meant by making such a fuss about her health.\\n\\n\"If people of my age WILL eat chicken-salad in the evening what are\\nthey to expect?\" she enquired; and, the doctor having opportunely\\nmodified her dietary, the stroke was transformed into an attack of\\nindigestion.  But in spite of her firm tone old Catherine did not\\nwholly recover her former attitude toward life.  The growing remoteness\\nof old age, though it had not diminished her curiosity about her\\nneighbours, had blunted her never very lively compassion for their\\ntroubles; and she seemed to have no difficulty in putting the Beaufort\\ndisaster out of her mind.  But for the first time she became absorbed\\nin her own symptoms, and began to take a sentimental interest in\\ncertain members of her family to whom she had hitherto been\\ncontemptuously indifferent.\\n\\nMr. Welland, in particular, had the privilege of attracting her notice.\\nOf her sons-in-law he was the one she had most consistently ignored;\\nand all his wife\\'s efforts to represent him as a man of forceful\\ncharacter and marked intellectual ability (if he had only \"chosen\") had\\nbeen met with a derisive chuckle.  But his eminence as a valetudinarian\\nnow made him an object of engrossing interest, and Mrs. Mingott issued\\nan imperial summons to him to come and compare diets as soon as his\\ntemperature permitted; for old Catherine was now the first to recognise\\nthat one could not be too careful about temperatures.\\n\\nTwenty-four hours after Madame Olenska\\'s summons a telegram announced\\nthat she would arrive from Washington on the evening of the following\\nday.  At the Wellands\\', where the Newland Archers chanced to be\\nlunching, the question as to who should meet her at Jersey City was\\nimmediately raised; and the material difficulties amid which the\\nWelland household struggled as if it had been a frontier outpost, lent\\nanimation to the debate.  It was agreed that Mrs. Welland could not\\npossibly go to Jersey City because she was to accompany her husband to\\nold Catherine\\'s that afternoon, and the brougham could not be spared,\\nsince, if Mr. Welland were \"upset\" by seeing his mother-in-law for the\\nfirst time after her attack, he might have to be taken home at a\\nmoment\\'s notice.  The Welland sons would of course be \"down town,\" Mr.\\nLovell Mingott would be just hurrying back from his shooting, and the\\nMingott carriage engaged in meeting him; and one could not ask May, at\\nthe close of a winter afternoon, to go alone across the ferry to Jersey\\nCity, even in her own carriage.  Nevertheless, it might appear\\ninhospitable--and contrary to old Catherine\\'s express wishes--if Madame\\nOlenska were allowed to arrive without any of the family being at the\\nstation to receive her.  It was just like Ellen, Mrs. Welland\\'s tired\\nvoice implied, to place the family in such a dilemma.  \"It\\'s always one\\nthing after another,\" the poor lady grieved, in one of her rare revolts\\nagainst fate; \"the only thing that makes me think Mamma must be less\\nwell than Dr. Bencomb will admit is this morbid desire to have Ellen\\ncome at once, however inconvenient it is to meet her.\"\\n\\nThe words had been thoughtless, as the utterances of impatience often\\nare; and Mr. Welland was upon them with a pounce.\\n\\n\"Augusta,\" he said, turning pale and laying down his fork, \"have you\\nany other reason for thinking that Bencomb is less to be relied on than\\nhe was?  Have you noticed that he has been less conscientious than\\nusual in following up my case or your mother\\'s?\"\\n\\nIt was Mrs. Welland\\'s turn to grow pale as the endless consequences of\\nher blunder unrolled themselves before her; but she managed to laugh,\\nand take a second helping of scalloped oysters, before she said,\\nstruggling back into her old armour of cheerfulness: \"My dear, how\\ncould you imagine such a thing?  I only meant that, after the decided\\nstand Mamma took about its being Ellen\\'s duty to go back to her\\nhusband, it seems strange that she should be seized with this sudden\\nwhim to see her, when there are half a dozen other grandchildren that\\nshe might have asked for.  But we must never forget that Mamma, in\\nspite of her wonderful vitality, is a very old woman.\"\\n\\nMr. Welland\\'s brow remained clouded, and it was evident that his\\nperturbed imagination had fastened at once on this last remark.  \"Yes:\\nyour mother\\'s a very old woman; and for all we know Bencomb may not be\\nas successful with very old people.  As you say, my dear, it\\'s always\\none thing after another; and in another ten or fifteen years I suppose\\nI shall have the pleasing duty of looking about for a new doctor.  It\\'s\\nalways better to make such a change before it\\'s absolutely necessary.\"\\nAnd having arrived at this Spartan decision Mr. Welland firmly took up\\nhis fork.\\n\\n\"But all the while,\" Mrs. Welland began again, as she rose from the\\nluncheon-table, and led the way into the wilderness of purple satin and\\nmalachite known as the back drawing-room, \"I don\\'t see how Ellen\\'s to\\nbe got here tomorrow evening; and I do like to have things settled for\\nat least twenty-four hours ahead.\"\\n\\nArcher turned from the fascinated contemplation of a small painting\\nrepresenting two Cardinals carousing, in an octagonal ebony frame set\\nwith medallions of onyx.\\n\\n\"Shall I fetch her?\" he proposed.  \"I can easily get away from the\\noffice in time to meet the brougham at the ferry, if May will send it\\nthere.\"  His heart was beating excitedly as he spoke.\\n\\nMrs. Welland heaved a sigh of gratitude, and May, who had moved away to\\nthe window, turned to shed on him a beam of approval.  \"So you see,\\nMamma, everything WILL be settled twenty-four hours in advance,\" she\\nsaid, stooping over to kiss her mother\\'s troubled forehead.\\n\\nMay\\'s brougham awaited her at the door, and she was to drive Archer to\\nUnion Square, where he could pick up a Broadway car to carry him to the\\noffice.  As she settled herself in her corner she said:  \"I didn\\'t want\\nto worry Mamma by raising fresh obstacles; but how can you meet Ellen\\ntomorrow, and bring her back to New York, when you\\'re going to\\nWashington?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m not going,\" Archer answered.\\n\\n\"Not going?  Why, what\\'s happened?\"  Her voice was as clear as a bell,\\nand full of wifely solicitude.\\n\\n\"The case is off--postponed.\"\\n\\n\"Postponed?  How odd!  I saw a note this morning from Mr. Letterblair\\nto Mamma saying that he was going to Washington tomorrow for the big\\npatent case that he was to argue before the Supreme Court.  You said it\\nwas a patent case, didn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Well--that\\'s it: the whole office can\\'t go.  Letterblair decided to go\\nthis morning.\"\\n\\n\"Then it\\'s NOT postponed?\" she continued, with an insistence so unlike\\nher that he felt the blood rising to his face, as if he were blushing\\nfor her unwonted lapse from all the traditional delicacies.\\n\\n\"No: but my going is,\" he answered, cursing the unnecessary\\nexplanations that he had given when he had announced his intention of\\ngoing to Washington, and wondering where he had read that clever liars\\ngive details, but that the cleverest do not.  It did not hurt him half\\nas much to tell May an untruth as to see her trying to pretend that she\\nhad not detected him.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not going till later on: luckily for the convenience of your\\nfamily,\" he continued, taking base refuge in sarcasm.  As he spoke he\\nfelt that she was looking at him, and he turned his eyes to hers in\\norder not to appear to be avoiding them.  Their glances met for a\\nsecond, and perhaps let them into each other\\'s meanings more deeply\\nthan either cared to go.\\n\\n\"Yes; it IS awfully convenient,\" May brightly agreed, \"that you should\\nbe able to meet Ellen after all; you saw how much Mamma appreciated\\nyour offering to do it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m delighted to do it.\"  The carriage stopped, and as he jumped\\nout she leaned to him and laid her hand on his.  \"Good-bye, dearest,\"\\nshe said, her eyes so blue that he wondered afterward if they had shone\\non him through tears.\\n\\nHe turned away and hurried across Union Square, repeating to himself,\\nin a sort of inward chant:  \"It\\'s all of two hours from Jersey City to\\nold Catherine\\'s.  It\\'s all of two hours--and it may be more.\"\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nThe next evening old Mr. Sillerton Jackson came to dine with the\\nArchers.\\n\\nMrs. Archer was a shy woman and shrank from society; but she liked to\\nbe well-informed as to its doings.  Her old friend Mr. Sillerton\\nJackson applied to the investigation of his friends\\' affairs the\\npatience of a collector and the science of a naturalist; and his\\nsister, Miss Sophy Jackson, who lived with him, and was entertained by\\nall the people who could not secure her much-sought-after brother,\\nbrought home bits of minor gossip that filled out usefully the gaps in\\nhis picture.\\n\\nTherefore, whenever anything happened that Mrs. Archer wanted to know\\nabout, she asked Mr. Jackson to dine; and as she honoured few people\\nwith her invitations, and as she and her daughter Janey were an\\nexcellent audience, Mr. Jackson usually came himself instead of sending\\nhis sister.  If he could have dictated all the conditions, he would\\nhave chosen the evenings when Newland was out; not because the young\\nman was uncongenial to him (the two got on capitally at their club) but\\nbecause the old anecdotist sometimes felt, on Newland\\'s part, a\\ntendency to weigh his evidence that the ladies of the family never\\nshowed.\\n\\nMr. Jackson, if perfection had been attainable on earth, would also\\nhave asked that Mrs. Archer\\'s food should be a little better.  But then\\nNew York, as far back as the mind of man could travel, had been divided\\ninto the two great fundamental groups of the Mingotts and Mansons and\\nall their clan, who cared about eating and clothes and money, and the\\nArcher-Newland-van-der-Luyden tribe, who were devoted to travel,\\nhorticulture and the best fiction, and looked down on the grosser forms\\nof pleasure.\\n\\nYou couldn\\'t have everything, after all.  If you dined with the Lovell\\nMingotts you got canvas-back and terrapin and vintage wines; at Adeline\\nArcher\\'s you could talk about Alpine scenery and \"The Marble Faun\"; and\\nluckily the Archer Madeira had gone round the Cape.  Therefore when a\\nfriendly summons came from Mrs. Archer, Mr. Jackson, who was a true\\neclectic, would usually say to his sister:  \"I\\'ve been a little gouty\\nsince my last dinner at the Lovell Mingotts\\'--it will do me good to\\ndiet at Adeline\\'s.\"\\n\\nMrs. Archer, who had long been a widow, lived with her son and daughter\\nin West Twenty-eighth Street.  An upper floor was dedicated to Newland,\\nand the two women squeezed themselves into narrower quarters below.  In\\nan unclouded harmony of tastes and interests they cultivated ferns in\\nWardian cases, made macrame lace and wool embroidery on linen,\\ncollected American revolutionary glazed ware, subscribed to \"Good\\nWords,\" and read Ouida\\'s novels for the sake of the Italian atmosphere.\\n(They preferred those about peasant life, because of the descriptions\\nof scenery and the pleasanter sentiments, though in general they liked\\nnovels about people in society, whose motives and habits were more\\ncomprehensible, spoke severely of Dickens, who \"had never drawn a\\ngentleman,\" and considered Thackeray less at home in the great world\\nthan Bulwer--who, however, was beginning to be thought old-fashioned.)\\nMrs. and Miss Archer were both great lovers of scenery.  It was what\\nthey principally sought and admired on their occasional travels abroad;\\nconsidering architecture and painting as subjects for men, and chiefly\\nfor learned persons who read Ruskin.  Mrs. Archer had been born a\\nNewland, and mother and daughter, who were as like as sisters, were\\nboth, as people said, \"true Newlands\"; tall, pale, and slightly\\nround-shouldered, with long noses, sweet smiles and a kind of drooping\\ndistinction like that in certain faded Reynolds portraits.  Their\\nphysical resemblance would have been complete if an elderly embonpoint\\nhad not stretched Mrs. Archer\\'s black brocade, while Miss Archer\\'s\\nbrown and purple poplins hung, as the years went on, more and more\\nslackly on her virgin frame.\\n\\nMentally, the likeness between them, as Newland was aware, was less\\ncomplete than their identical mannerisms often made it appear.  The\\nlong habit of living together in mutually dependent intimacy had given\\nthem the same vocabulary, and the same habit of beginning their phrases\\n\"Mother thinks\" or \"Janey thinks,\" according as one or the other wished\\nto advance an opinion of her own; but in reality, while Mrs. Archer\\'s\\nserene unimaginativeness rested easily in the accepted and familiar,\\nJaney was subject to starts and aberrations of fancy welling up from\\nsprings of suppressed romance.\\n\\nMother and daughter adored each other and revered their son and\\nbrother; and Archer loved them with a tenderness made compunctious and\\nuncritical by the sense of their exaggerated admiration, and by his\\nsecret satisfaction in it.  After all, he thought it a good thing for a\\nman to have his authority respected in his own house, even if his sense\\nof humour sometimes made him question the force of his mandate.\\n\\nOn this occasion the young man was very sure that Mr. Jackson would\\nrather have had him dine out; but he had his own reasons for not doing\\nso.\\n\\nOf course old Jackson wanted to talk about Ellen Olenska, and of course\\nMrs. Archer and Janey wanted to hear what he had to tell.  All three\\nwould be slightly embarrassed by Newland\\'s presence, now that his\\nprospective relation to the Mingott clan had been made known; and the\\nyoung man waited with an amused curiosity to see how they would turn\\nthe difficulty.\\n\\nThey began, obliquely, by talking about Mrs. Lemuel Struthers.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a pity the Beauforts asked her,\" Mrs. Archer said gently.  \"But\\nthen Regina always does what he tells her; and BEAUFORT--\"\\n\\n\"Certain nuances escape Beaufort,\" said Mr. Jackson, cautiously\\ninspecting the broiled shad, and wondering for the thousandth time why\\nMrs. Archer\\'s cook always burnt the roe to a cinder. (Newland, who had\\nlong shared his wonder, could always detect it in the older man\\'s\\nexpression of melancholy disapproval.)\\n\\n\"Oh, necessarily; Beaufort is a vulgar man,\" said Mrs. Archer.  \"My\\ngrandfather Newland always used to say to my mother:  \\'Whatever you do,\\ndon\\'t let that fellow Beaufort be introduced to the girls.\\'  But at\\nleast he\\'s had the advantage of associating with gentlemen; in England\\ntoo, they say.  It\\'s all very mysterious--\" She glanced at Janey and\\npaused.  She and Janey knew every fold of the Beaufort mystery, but in\\npublic Mrs. Archer continued to assume that the subject was not one for\\nthe unmarried.\\n\\n\"But this Mrs. Struthers,\" Mrs. Archer continued; \"what did you say SHE\\nwas, Sillerton?\"\\n\\n\"Out of a mine: or rather out of the saloon at the head of the pit.\\nThen with Living Wax-Works, touring New England.  After the police\\nbroke THAT up, they say she lived--\"  Mr. Jackson in his turn glanced\\nat Janey, whose eyes began to bulge from under her prominent lids.\\nThere were still hiatuses for her in Mrs. Struthers\\'s past.\\n\\n\"Then,\" Mr. Jackson continued (and Archer saw he was wondering why no\\none had told the butler never to slice cucumbers with a steel knife),\\n\"then Lemuel Struthers came along.  They say his advertiser used the\\ngirl\\'s head for the shoe-polish posters; her hair\\'s intensely black,\\nyou know--the Egyptian style.  Anyhow, he--eventually--married her.\"\\nThere were volumes of innuendo in the way the \"eventually\" was spaced,\\nand each syllable given its due stress.\\n\\n\"Oh, well--at the pass we\\'ve come to nowadays, it doesn\\'t matter,\" said\\nMrs. Archer indifferently.  The ladies were not really interested in\\nMrs. Struthers just then; the subject of Ellen Olenska was too fresh\\nand too absorbing to them.  Indeed, Mrs. Struthers\\'s name had been\\nintroduced by Mrs. Archer only that she might presently be able to say:\\n\"And Newland\\'s new cousin--Countess Olenska?  Was SHE at the ball too?\"\\n\\nThere was a faint touch of sarcasm in the reference to her son, and\\nArcher knew it and had expected it.  Even Mrs. Archer, who was seldom\\nunduly pleased with human events, had been altogether glad of her son\\'s\\nengagement. (\"Especially after that silly business with Mrs.\\nRushworth,\" as she had remarked to Janey, alluding to what had once\\nseemed to Newland a tragedy of which his soul would always bear the\\nscar.)\\n\\nThere was no better match in New York than May Welland, look at the\\nquestion from whatever point you chose.  Of course such a marriage was\\nonly what Newland was entitled to; but young men are so foolish and\\nincalculable--and some women so ensnaring and unscrupulous--that it was\\nnothing short of a miracle to see one\\'s only son safe past the Siren\\nIsle and in the haven of a blameless domesticity.\\n\\nAll this Mrs. Archer felt, and her son knew she felt; but he knew also\\nthat she had been perturbed by the premature announcement of his\\nengagement, or rather by its cause; and it was for that reason--because\\non the whole he was a tender and indulgent master--that he had stayed\\nat home that evening.  \"It\\'s not that I don\\'t approve of the Mingotts\\'\\nesprit de corps; but why Newland\\'s engagement should be mixed up with\\nthat Olenska woman\\'s comings and goings I don\\'t see,\" Mrs. Archer\\ngrumbled to Janey, the only witness of her slight lapses from perfect\\nsweetness.\\n\\nShe had behaved beautifully--and in beautiful behaviour she was\\nunsurpassed--during the call on Mrs. Welland; but Newland knew (and his\\nbetrothed doubtless guessed) that all through the visit she and Janey\\nwere nervously on the watch for Madame Olenska\\'s possible intrusion;\\nand when they left the house together she had permitted herself to say\\nto her son:  \"I\\'m thankful that Augusta Welland received us alone.\"\\n\\nThese indications of inward disturbance moved Archer the more that he\\ntoo felt that the Mingotts had gone a little too far.  But, as it was\\nagainst all the rules of their code that the mother and son should ever\\nallude to what was uppermost in their thoughts, he simply replied: \"Oh,\\nwell, there\\'s always a phase of family parties to be gone through when\\none gets engaged, and the sooner it\\'s over the better.\"  At which his\\nmother merely pursed her lips under the lace veil that hung down from\\nher grey velvet bonnet trimmed with frosted grapes.\\n\\nHer revenge, he felt--her lawful revenge--would be to \"draw\" Mr.\\nJackson that evening on the Countess Olenska; and, having publicly done\\nhis duty as a future member of the Mingott clan, the young man had no\\nobjection to hearing the lady discussed in private--except that the\\nsubject was already beginning to bore him.\\n\\nMr. Jackson had helped himself to a slice of the tepid filet which the\\nmournful butler had handed him with a look as sceptical as his own, and\\nhad rejected the mushroom sauce after a scarcely perceptible sniff.  He\\nlooked baffled and hungry, and Archer reflected that he would probably\\nfinish his meal on Ellen Olenska.\\n\\nMr. Jackson leaned back in his chair, and glanced up at the candlelit\\nArchers, Newlands and van der Luydens hanging in dark frames on the\\ndark walls.\\n\\n\"Ah, how your grandfather Archer loved a good dinner, my dear Newland!\"\\nhe said, his eyes on the portrait of a plump full-chested young man in\\na stock and a blue coat, with a view of a white-columned country-house\\nbehind him.  \"Well--well--well ... I wonder what he would have said to\\nall these foreign marriages!\"\\n\\nMrs. Archer ignored the allusion to the ancestral cuisine and Mr.\\nJackson continued with deliberation: \"No, she was NOT at the ball.\"\\n\\n\"Ah--\" Mrs. Archer murmured, in a tone that implied:  \"She had that\\ndecency.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps the Beauforts don\\'t know her,\" Janey suggested, with her\\nartless malice.\\n\\nMr. Jackson gave a faint sip, as if he had been tasting invisible\\nMadeira.  \"Mrs. Beaufort may not--but Beaufort certainly does, for she\\nwas seen walking up Fifth Avenue this afternoon with him by the whole\\nof New York.\"\\n\\n\"Mercy--\" moaned Mrs. Archer, evidently perceiving the uselessness of\\ntrying to ascribe the actions of foreigners to a sense of delicacy.\\n\\n\"I wonder if she wears a round hat or a bonnet in the afternoon,\" Janey\\nspeculated.  \"At the Opera I know she had on dark blue velvet,\\nperfectly plain and flat--like a night-gown.\"\\n\\n\"Janey!\" said her mother; and Miss Archer blushed and tried to look\\naudacious.\\n\\n\"It was, at any rate, in better taste not to go to the ball,\" Mrs.\\nArcher continued.\\n\\nA spirit of perversity moved her son to rejoin:  \"I don\\'t think it was\\na question of taste with her.  May said she meant to go, and then\\ndecided that the dress in question wasn\\'t smart enough.\"\\n\\nMrs. Archer smiled at this confirmation of her inference.  \"Poor\\nEllen,\" she simply remarked; adding compassionately:  \"We must always\\nbear in mind what an eccentric bringing-up Medora Manson gave her.\\nWhat can you expect of a girl who was allowed to wear black satin at\\nher coming-out ball?\"\\n\\n\"Ah--don\\'t I remember her in it!\" said Mr. Jackson; adding:  \"Poor\\ngirl!\" in the tone of one who, while enjoying the memory, had fully\\nunderstood at the time what the sight portended.\\n\\n\"It\\'s odd,\" Janey remarked, \"that she should have kept such an ugly\\nname as Ellen.  I should have changed it to Elaine.\"  She glanced about\\nthe table to see the effect of this.\\n\\nHer brother laughed.  \"Why Elaine?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know; it sounds more--more Polish,\" said Janey, blushing.\\n\\n\"It sounds more conspicuous; and that can hardly be what she wishes,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Archer distantly.\\n\\n\"Why not?\" broke in her son, growing suddenly argumentative.  \"Why\\nshouldn\\'t she be conspicuous if she chooses?  Why should she slink\\nabout as if it were she who had disgraced herself?  She\\'s \\'poor Ellen\\'\\ncertainly, because she had the bad luck to make a wretched marriage;\\nbut I don\\'t see that that\\'s a reason for hiding her head as if she were\\nthe culprit.\"\\n\\n\"That, I suppose,\" said Mr. Jackson, speculatively, \"is the line the\\nMingotts mean to take.\"\\n\\nThe young man reddened.  \"I didn\\'t have to wait for their cue, if\\nthat\\'s what you mean, sir.  Madame Olenska has had an unhappy life:\\nthat doesn\\'t make her an outcast.\"\\n\\n\"There are rumours,\" began Mr. Jackson, glancing at Janey.\\n\\n\"Oh, I know: the secretary,\" the young man took him up.  \"Nonsense,\\nmother; Janey\\'s grown-up.  They say, don\\'t they,\" he went on, \"that the\\nsecretary helped her to get away from her brute of a husband, who kept\\nher practically a prisoner?  Well, what if he did?  I hope there isn\\'t\\na man among us who wouldn\\'t have done the same in such a case.\"\\n\\nMr. Jackson glanced over his shoulder to say to the sad butler:\\n\"Perhaps ... that sauce ... just a little, after all--\"; then, having\\nhelped himself, he remarked: \"I\\'m told she\\'s looking for a house.  She\\nmeans to live here.\"\\n\\n\"I hear she means to get a divorce,\" said Janey boldly.\\n\\n\"I hope she will!\" Archer exclaimed.\\n\\nThe word had fallen like a bombshell in the pure and tranquil\\natmosphere of the Archer dining-room.  Mrs. Archer raised her delicate\\neye-brows in the particular curve that signified:  \"The butler--\" and\\nthe young man, himself mindful of the bad taste of discussing such\\nintimate matters in public, hastily branched off into an account of his\\nvisit to old Mrs. Mingott.\\n\\nAfter dinner, according to immemorial custom, Mrs. Archer and Janey\\ntrailed their long silk draperies up to the drawing-room, where, while\\nthe gentlemen smoked below stairs, they sat beside a Carcel lamp with\\nan engraved globe, facing each other across a rosewood work-table with\\na green silk bag under it, and stitched at the two ends of a tapestry\\nband of field-flowers destined to adorn an \"occasional\" chair in the\\ndrawing-room of young Mrs. Newland Archer.\\n\\nWhile this rite was in progress in the drawing-room, Archer settled Mr.\\nJackson in an armchair near the fire in the Gothic library and handed\\nhim a cigar.  Mr. Jackson sank into the armchair with satisfaction, lit\\nhis cigar with perfect confidence (it was Newland who bought them), and\\nstretching his thin old ankles to the coals, said:  \"You say the\\nsecretary merely helped her to get away, my dear fellow?  Well, he was\\nstill helping her a year later, then; for somebody met \\'em living at\\nLausanne together.\"\\n\\nNewland reddened.  \"Living together?  Well, why not?  Who had the right\\nto make her life over if she hadn\\'t?  I\\'m sick of the hypocrisy that\\nwould bury alive a woman of her age if her husband prefers to live with\\nharlots.\"\\n\\nHe stopped and turned away angrily to light his cigar.  \"Women ought to\\nbe free--as free as we are,\" he declared, making a discovery of which\\nhe was too irritated to measure the terrific consequences.\\n\\nMr. Sillerton Jackson stretched his ankles nearer the coals and emitted\\na sardonic whistle.\\n\\n\"Well,\" he said after a pause, \"apparently Count Olenski takes your\\nview; for I never heard of his having lifted a finger to get his wife\\nback.\"\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nSome two weeks later, Newland Archer, sitting in abstracted idleness in\\nhis private compartment of the office of Letterblair, Lamson and Low,\\nattorneys at law, was summoned by the head of the firm.\\n\\nOld Mr. Letterblair, the accredited legal adviser of three generations\\nof New York gentility, throned behind his mahogany desk in evident\\nperplexity.  As he stroked his closeclipped white whiskers and ran his\\nhand through the rumpled grey locks above his jutting brows, his\\ndisrespectful junior partner thought how much he looked like the Family\\nPhysician annoyed with a patient whose symptoms refuse to be classified.\\n\\n\"My dear sir--\" he always addressed Archer as \"sir\"--\"I have sent for\\nyou to go into a little matter; a matter which, for the moment, I\\nprefer not to mention either to Mr. Skipworth or Mr. Redwood.\"  The\\ngentlemen he spoke of were the other senior partners of the firm; for,\\nas was always the case with legal associations of old standing in New\\nYork, all the partners named on the office letter-head were long since\\ndead; and Mr. Letterblair, for example, was, professionally speaking,\\nhis own grandson.\\n\\nHe leaned back in his chair with a furrowed brow.  \"For family\\nreasons--\" he continued.\\n\\nArcher looked up.\\n\\n\"The Mingott family,\" said Mr. Letterblair with an explanatory smile\\nand bow.  \"Mrs. Manson Mingott sent for me yesterday.  Her\\ngrand-daughter the Countess Olenska wishes to sue her husband for\\ndivorce.  Certain papers have been placed in my hands.\"  He paused and\\ndrummed on his desk.  \"In view of your prospective alliance with the\\nfamily I should like to consult you--to consider the case with\\nyou--before taking any farther steps.\"\\n\\nArcher felt the blood in his temples.  He had seen the Countess Olenska\\nonly once since his visit to her, and then at the Opera, in the Mingott\\nbox.  During this interval she had become a less vivid and importunate\\nimage, receding from his foreground as May Welland resumed her rightful\\nplace in it.  He had not heard her divorce spoken of since Janey\\'s\\nfirst random allusion to it, and had dismissed the tale as unfounded\\ngossip.  Theoretically, the idea of divorce was almost as distasteful\\nto him as to his mother; and he was annoyed that Mr. Letterblair (no\\ndoubt prompted by old Catherine Mingott) should be so evidently\\nplanning to draw him into the affair.  After all, there were plenty of\\nMingott men for such jobs, and as yet he was not even a Mingott by\\nmarriage.\\n\\nHe waited for the senior partner to continue.  Mr. Letterblair unlocked\\na drawer and drew out a packet.  \"If you will run your eye over these\\npapers--\"\\n\\nArcher frowned.  \"I beg your pardon, sir; but just because of the\\nprospective relationship, I should prefer your consulting Mr. Skipworth\\nor Mr. Redwood.\"\\n\\nMr. Letterblair looked surprised and slightly offended.  It was unusual\\nfor a junior to reject such an opening.\\n\\nHe bowed.  \"I respect your scruple, sir; but in this case I believe\\ntrue delicacy requires you to do as I ask.  Indeed, the suggestion is\\nnot mine but Mrs. Manson Mingott\\'s and her son\\'s.  I have seen Lovell\\nMingott; and also Mr. Welland.  They all named you.\"\\n\\nArcher felt his temper rising.  He had been somewhat languidly drifting\\nwith events for the last fortnight, and letting May\\'s fair looks and\\nradiant nature obliterate the rather importunate pressure of the\\nMingott claims.  But this behest of old Mrs. Mingott\\'s roused him to a\\nsense of what the clan thought they had the right to exact from a\\nprospective son-in-law; and he chafed at the role.\\n\\n\"Her uncles ought to deal with this,\" he said.\\n\\n\"They have.  The matter has been gone into by the family.  They are\\nopposed to the Countess\\'s idea; but she is firm, and insists on a legal\\nopinion.\"\\n\\nThe young man was silent: he had not opened the packet in his hand.\\n\\n\"Does she want to marry again?\"\\n\\n\"I believe it is suggested; but she denies it.\"\\n\\n\"Then--\"\\n\\n\"Will you oblige me, Mr. Archer, by first looking through these papers?\\nAfterward, when we have talked the case over, I will give you my\\nopinion.\"\\n\\nArcher withdrew reluctantly with the unwelcome documents.  Since their\\nlast meeting he had half-unconsciously collaborated with events in\\nridding himself of the burden of Madame Olenska.  His hour alone with\\nher by the firelight had drawn them into a momentary intimacy on which\\nthe Duke of St. Austrey\\'s intrusion with Mrs. Lemuel Struthers, and the\\nCountess\\'s joyous greeting of them, had rather providentially broken.\\nTwo days later Archer had assisted at the comedy of her reinstatement\\nin the van der Luydens\\' favour, and had said to himself, with a touch\\nof tartness, that a lady who knew how to thank all-powerful elderly\\ngentlemen to such good purpose for a bunch of flowers did not need\\neither the private consolations or the public championship of a young\\nman of his small compass.  To look at the matter in this light\\nsimplified his own case and surprisingly furbished up all the dim\\ndomestic virtues.  He could not picture May Welland, in whatever\\nconceivable emergency, hawking about her private difficulties and\\nlavishing her confidences on strange men; and she had never seemed to\\nhim finer or fairer than in the week that followed.  He had even\\nyielded to her wish for a long engagement, since she had found the one\\ndisarming answer to his plea for haste.\\n\\n\"You know, when it comes to the point, your parents have always let you\\nhave your way ever since you were a little girl,\" he argued; and she\\nhad answered, with her clearest look:  \"Yes; and that\\'s what makes it\\nso hard to refuse the very last thing they\\'ll ever ask of me as a\\nlittle girl.\"\\n\\nThat was the old New York note; that was the kind of answer he would\\nlike always to be sure of his wife\\'s making.  If one had habitually\\nbreathed the New York air there were times when anything less\\ncrystalline seemed stifling.\\n\\n\\nThe papers he had retired to read did not tell him much in fact; but\\nthey plunged him into an atmosphere in which he choked and spluttered.\\nThey consisted mainly of an exchange of letters between Count Olenski\\'s\\nsolicitors and a French legal firm to whom the Countess had applied for\\nthe settlement of her financial situation.  There was also a short\\nletter from the Count to his wife: after reading it, Newland Archer\\nrose, jammed the papers back into their envelope, and reentered Mr.\\nLetterblair\\'s office.\\n\\n\"Here are the letters, sir.  If you wish, I\\'ll see Madame Olenska,\" he\\nsaid in a constrained voice.\\n\\n\"Thank you--thank you, Mr. Archer.  Come and dine with me tonight if\\nyou\\'re free, and we\\'ll go into the matter afterward: in case you wish\\nto call on our client tomorrow.\"\\n\\nNewland Archer walked straight home again that afternoon.  It was a\\nwinter evening of transparent clearness, with an innocent young moon\\nabove the house-tops; and he wanted to fill his soul\\'s lungs with the\\npure radiance, and not exchange a word with any one till he and Mr.\\nLetterblair were closeted together after dinner.  It was impossible to\\ndecide otherwise than he had done: he must see Madame Olenska himself\\nrather than let her secrets be bared to other eyes.  A great wave of\\ncompassion had swept away his indifference and impatience: she stood\\nbefore him as an exposed and pitiful figure, to be saved at all costs\\nfrom farther wounding herself in her mad plunges against fate.\\n\\nHe remembered what she had told him of Mrs. Welland\\'s request to be\\nspared whatever was \"unpleasant\" in her history, and winced at the\\nthought that it was perhaps this attitude of mind which kept the New\\nYork air so pure.  \"Are we only Pharisees after all?\" he wondered,\\npuzzled by the effort to reconcile his instinctive disgust at human\\nvileness with his equally instinctive pity for human frailty.\\n\\nFor the first time he perceived how elementary his own principles had\\nalways been.  He passed for a young man who had not been afraid of\\nrisks, and he knew that his secret love-affair with poor silly Mrs.\\nThorley Rushworth had not been too secret to invest him with a becoming\\nair of adventure.  But Mrs. Rushworth was \"that kind of woman\";\\nfoolish, vain, clandestine by nature, and far more attracted by the\\nsecrecy and peril of the affair than by such charms and qualities as he\\npossessed.  When the fact dawned on him it nearly broke his heart, but\\nnow it seemed the redeeming feature of the case.  The affair, in short,\\nhad been of the kind that most of the young men of his age had been\\nthrough, and emerged from with calm consciences and an undisturbed\\nbelief in the abysmal distinction between the women one loved and\\nrespected and those one enjoyed--and pitied.  In this view they were\\nsedulously abetted by their mothers, aunts and other elderly female\\nrelatives, who all shared Mrs. Archer\\'s belief that when \"such things\\nhappened\" it was undoubtedly foolish of the man, but somehow always\\ncriminal of the woman.  All the elderly ladies whom Archer knew\\nregarded any woman who loved imprudently as necessarily unscrupulous\\nand designing, and mere simple-minded man as powerless in her clutches.\\nThe only thing to do was to persuade him, as early as possible, to\\nmarry a nice girl, and then trust to her to look after him.\\n\\nIn the complicated old European communities, Archer began to guess,\\nlove-problems might be less simple and less easily classified.  Rich\\nand idle and ornamental societies must produce many more such\\nsituations; and there might even be one in which a woman naturally\\nsensitive and aloof would yet, from the force of circumstances, from\\nsheer defencelessness and loneliness, be drawn into a tie inexcusable\\nby conventional standards.\\n\\nOn reaching home he wrote a line to the Countess Olenska, asking at\\nwhat hour of the next day she could receive him, and despatched it by a\\nmessenger-boy, who returned presently with a word to the effect that\\nshe was going to Skuytercliff the next morning to stay over Sunday with\\nthe van der Luydens, but that he would find her alone that evening\\nafter dinner.  The note was written on a rather untidy half-sheet,\\nwithout date or address, but her hand was firm and free.  He was amused\\nat the idea of her week-ending in the stately solitude of Skuytercliff,\\nbut immediately afterward felt that there, of all places, she would\\nmost feel the chill of minds rigorously averted from the \"unpleasant.\"\\n\\n\\nHe was at Mr. Letterblair\\'s punctually at seven, glad of the pretext\\nfor excusing himself soon after dinner.  He had formed his own opinion\\nfrom the papers entrusted to him, and did not especially want to go\\ninto the matter with his senior partner.  Mr. Letterblair was a\\nwidower, and they dined alone, copiously and slowly, in a dark shabby\\nroom hung with yellowing prints of \"The Death of Chatham\" and \"The\\nCoronation of Napoleon.\"  On the sideboard, between fluted Sheraton\\nknife-cases, stood a decanter of Haut Brion, and another of the old\\nLanning port (the gift of a client), which the wastrel Tom Lanning had\\nsold off a year or two before his mysterious and discreditable death in\\nSan Francisco--an incident less publicly humiliating to the family than\\nthe sale of the cellar.\\n\\nAfter a velvety oyster soup came shad and cucumbers, then a young\\nbroiled turkey with corn fritters, followed by a canvas-back with\\ncurrant jelly and a celery mayonnaise.  Mr. Letterblair, who lunched on\\na sandwich and tea, dined deliberately and deeply, and insisted on his\\nguest\\'s doing the same.  Finally, when the closing rites had been\\naccomplished, the cloth was removed, cigars were lit, and Mr.\\nLetterblair, leaning back in his chair and pushing the port westward,\\nsaid, spreading his back agreeably to the coal fire behind him:  \"The\\nwhole family are against a divorce.  And I think rightly.\"\\n\\nArcher instantly felt himself on the other side of the argument.  \"But\\nwhy, sir?  If there ever was a case--\"\\n\\n\"Well--what\\'s the use?  SHE\\'S here--he\\'s there; the Atlantic\\'s between\\nthem.  She\\'ll never get back a dollar more of her money than what he\\'s\\nvoluntarily returned to her: their damned heathen marriage settlements\\ntake precious good care of that.  As things go over there, Olenski\\'s\\nacted generously: he might have turned her out without a penny.\"\\n\\nThe young man knew this and was silent.\\n\\n\"I understand, though,\" Mr. Letterblair continued, \"that she attaches\\nno importance to the money.  Therefore, as the family say, why not let\\nwell enough alone?\"\\n\\nArcher had gone to the house an hour earlier in full agreement with Mr.\\nLetterblair\\'s view; but put into words by this selfish, well-fed and\\nsupremely indifferent old man it suddenly became the Pharisaic voice of\\na society wholly absorbed in barricading itself against the unpleasant.\\n\\n\"I think that\\'s for her to decide.\"\\n\\n\"H\\'m--have you considered the consequences if she decides for divorce?\"\\n\\n\"You mean the threat in her husband\\'s letter?  What weight would that\\ncarry?  It\\'s no more than the vague charge of an angry blackguard.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but it might make some unpleasant talk if he really defends the\\nsuit.\"\\n\\n\"Unpleasant--!\" said Archer explosively.\\n\\nMr. Letterblair looked at him from under enquiring eyebrows, and the\\nyoung man, aware of the uselessness of trying to explain what was in\\nhis mind, bowed acquiescently while his senior continued:  \"Divorce is\\nalways unpleasant.\"\\n\\n\"You agree with me?\" Mr. Letterblair resumed, after a waiting silence.\\n\\n\"Naturally,\" said Archer.\\n\\n\"Well, then, I may count on you; the Mingotts may count on you; to use\\nyour influence against the idea?\"\\n\\nArcher hesitated.  \"I can\\'t pledge myself till I\\'ve seen the Countess\\nOlenska,\" he said at length.\\n\\n\"Mr. Archer, I don\\'t understand you.  Do you want to marry into a\\nfamily with a scandalous divorce-suit hanging over it?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think that has anything to do with the case.\"\\n\\nMr. Letterblair put down his glass of port and fixed on his young\\npartner a cautious and apprehensive gaze.\\n\\nArcher understood that he ran the risk of having his mandate withdrawn,\\nand for some obscure reason he disliked the prospect.  Now that the job\\nhad been thrust on him he did not propose to relinquish it; and, to\\nguard against the possibility, he saw that he must reassure the\\nunimaginative old man who was the legal conscience of the Mingotts.\\n\\n\"You may be sure, sir, that I shan\\'t commit myself till I\\'ve reported\\nto you; what I meant was that I\\'d rather not give an opinion till I\\'ve\\nheard what Madame Olenska has to say.\"\\n\\nMr. Letterblair nodded approvingly at an excess of caution worthy of\\nthe best New York tradition, and the young man, glancing at his watch,\\npleaded an engagement and took leave.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\n\"At the court of the Tuileries,\" said Mr. Sillerton Jackson with his\\nreminiscent smile, \"such things were pretty openly tolerated.\"\\n\\nThe scene was the van der Luydens\\' black walnut dining-room in Madison\\nAvenue, and the time the evening after Newland Archer\\'s visit to the\\nMuseum of Art.  Mr. and Mrs. van der Luyden had come to town for a few\\ndays from Skuytercliff, whither they had precipitately fled at the\\nannouncement of Beaufort\\'s failure.  It had been represented to them\\nthat the disarray into which society had been thrown by this deplorable\\naffair made their presence in town more necessary than ever.  It was\\none of the occasions when, as Mrs. Archer put it, they \"owed it to\\nsociety\" to show themselves at the Opera, and even to open their own\\ndoors.\\n\\n\"It will never do, my dear Louisa, to let people like Mrs. Lemuel\\nStruthers think they can step into Regina\\'s shoes.  It is just at such\\ntimes that new people push in and get a footing.  It was owing to the\\nepidemic of chicken-pox in New York the winter Mrs. Struthers first\\nappeared that the married men slipped away to her house while their\\nwives were in the nursery.  You and dear Henry, Louisa, must stand in\\nthe breach as you always have.\"\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. van der Luyden could not remain deaf to such a call, and\\nreluctantly but heroically they had come to town, unmuffled the house,\\nand sent out invitations for two dinners and an evening reception.\\n\\nOn this particular evening they had invited Sillerton Jackson, Mrs.\\nArcher and Newland and his wife to go with them to the Opera, where\\nFaust was being sung for the first time that winter.  Nothing was done\\nwithout ceremony under the van der Luyden roof, and though there were\\nbut four guests the repast had begun at seven punctually, so that the\\nproper sequence of courses might be served without haste before the\\ngentlemen settled down to their cigars.\\n\\nArcher had not seen his wife since the evening before.  He had left\\nearly for the office, where he had plunged into an accumulation of\\nunimportant business.  In the afternoon one of the senior partners had\\nmade an unexpected call on his time; and he had reached home so late\\nthat May had preceded him to the van der Luydens\\', and sent back the\\ncarriage.\\n\\nNow, across the Skuytercliff carnations and the massive plate, she\\nstruck him as pale and languid; but her eyes shone, and she talked with\\nexaggerated animation.\\n\\nThe subject which had called forth Mr. Sillerton Jackson\\'s favourite\\nallusion had been brought up (Archer fancied not without intention) by\\ntheir hostess.  The Beaufort failure, or rather the Beaufort attitude\\nsince the failure, was still a fruitful theme for the drawing-room\\nmoralist; and after it had been thoroughly examined and condemned Mrs.\\nvan der Luyden had turned her scrupulous eyes on May Archer.\\n\\n\"Is it possible, dear, that what I hear is true?  I was told your\\ngrandmother Mingott\\'s carriage was seen standing at Mrs. Beaufort\\'s\\ndoor.\"  It was noticeable that she no longer called the offending lady\\nby her Christian name.\\n\\nMay\\'s colour rose, and Mrs. Archer put in hastily: \"If it was, I\\'m\\nconvinced it was there without Mrs. Mingott\\'s knowledge.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, you think--?\"  Mrs. van der Luyden paused, sighed, and glanced at\\nher husband.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid,\" Mr. van der Luyden said, \"that Madame Olenska\\'s kind\\nheart may have led her into the imprudence of calling on Mrs. Beaufort.\"\\n\\n\"Or her taste for peculiar people,\" put in Mrs. Archer in a dry tone,\\nwhile her eyes dwelt innocently on her son\\'s.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry to think it of Madame Olenska,\" said Mrs. van der Luyden;\\nand Mrs. Archer murmured: \"Ah, my dear--and after you\\'d had her twice\\nat Skuytercliff!\"\\n\\nIt was at this point that Mr. Jackson seized the chance to place his\\nfavourite allusion.\\n\\n\"At the Tuileries,\" he repeated, seeing the eyes of the company\\nexpectantly turned on him, \"the standard was excessively lax in some\\nrespects; and if you\\'d asked where Morny\\'s money came from--!  Or who\\npaid the debts of some of the Court beauties ...\"\\n\\n\"I hope, dear Sillerton,\" said Mrs. Archer, \"you are not suggesting\\nthat we should adopt such standards?\"\\n\\n\"I never suggest,\" returned Mr. Jackson imperturbably.  \"But Madame\\nOlenska\\'s foreign bringing-up may make her less particular--\"\\n\\n\"Ah,\" the two elder ladies sighed.\\n\\n\"Still, to have kept her grandmother\\'s carriage at a defaulter\\'s door!\"\\nMr. van der Luyden protested; and Archer guessed that he was\\nremembering, and resenting, the hampers of carnations he had sent to\\nthe little house in Twenty-third Street.\\n\\n\"Of course I\\'ve always said that she looks at things quite\\ndifferently,\" Mrs. Archer summed up.\\n\\nA flush rose to May\\'s forehead.  She looked across the table at her\\nhusband, and said precipitately:  \"I\\'m sure Ellen meant it kindly.\"\\n\\n\"Imprudent people are often kind,\" said Mrs. Archer, as if the fact\\nwere scarcely an extenuation; and Mrs. van der Luyden murmured:  \"If\\nonly she had consulted some one--\"\\n\\n\"Ah, that she never did!\" Mrs. Archer rejoined.\\n\\nAt this point Mr. van der Luyden glanced at his wife, who bent her head\\nslightly in the direction of Mrs. Archer; and the glimmering trains of\\nthe three ladies swept out of the door while the gentlemen settled down\\nto their cigars.  Mr. van der Luyden supplied short ones on Opera\\nnights; but they were so good that they made his guests deplore his\\ninexorable punctuality.\\n\\nArcher, after the first act, had detached himself from the party and\\nmade his way to the back of the club box.  From there he watched, over\\nvarious Chivers, Mingott and Rushworth shoulders, the same scene that\\nhe had looked at, two years previously, on the night of his first\\nmeeting with Ellen Olenska.  He had half-expected her to appear again\\nin old Mrs. Mingott\\'s box, but it remained empty; and he sat\\nmotionless, his eyes fastened on it, till suddenly Madame Nilsson\\'s\\npure soprano broke out into \"M\\'ama, non m\\'ama ...\"\\n\\nArcher turned to the stage, where, in the familiar setting of giant\\nroses and pen-wiper pansies, the same large blonde victim was\\nsuccumbing to the same small brown seducer.\\n\\nFrom the stage his eyes wandered to the point of the horseshoe where\\nMay sat between two older ladies, just as, on that former evening, she\\nhad sat between Mrs. Lovell Mingott and her newly-arrived \"foreign\"\\ncousin.  As on that evening, she was all in white; and Archer, who had\\nnot noticed what she wore, recognised the blue-white satin and old lace\\nof her wedding dress.\\n\\nIt was the custom, in old New York, for brides to appear in this costly\\ngarment during the first year or two of marriage: his mother, he knew,\\nkept hers in tissue paper in the hope that Janey might some day wear\\nit, though poor Janey was reaching the age when pearl grey poplin and\\nno bridesmaids would be thought more \"appropriate.\"\\n\\nIt struck Archer that May, since their return from Europe, had seldom\\nworn her bridal satin, and the surprise of seeing her in it made him\\ncompare her appearance with that of the young girl he had watched with\\nsuch blissful anticipations two years earlier.\\n\\nThough May\\'s outline was slightly heavier, as her goddesslike build had\\nforetold, her athletic erectness of carriage, and the girlish\\ntransparency of her expression, remained unchanged: but for the slight\\nlanguor that Archer had lately noticed in her she would have been the\\nexact image of the girl playing with the bouquet of\\nlilies-of-the-valley on her betrothal evening.  The fact seemed an\\nadditional appeal to his pity: such innocence was as moving as the\\ntrustful clasp of a child.  Then he remembered the passionate\\ngenerosity latent under that incurious calm.  He recalled her glance of\\nunderstanding when he had urged that their engagement should be\\nannounced at the Beaufort ball; he heard the voice in which she had\\nsaid, in the Mission garden:  \"I couldn\\'t have my happiness made out of\\na wrong--a wrong to some one else;\" and an uncontrollable longing\\nseized him to tell her the truth, to throw himself on her generosity,\\nand ask for the freedom he had once refused.\\n\\nNewland Archer was a quiet and self-controlled young man.  Conformity\\nto the discipline of a small society had become almost his second\\nnature.  It was deeply distasteful to him to do anything melodramatic\\nand conspicuous, anything Mr. van der Luyden would have deprecated and\\nthe club box condemned as bad form.  But he had become suddenly\\nunconscious of the club box, of Mr. van der Luyden, of all that had so\\nlong enclosed him in the warm shelter of habit.  He walked along the\\nsemi-circular passage at the back of the house, and opened the door of\\nMrs. van der Luyden\\'s box as if it had been a gate into the unknown.\\n\\n\"M\\'ama!\" thrilled out the triumphant Marguerite; and the occupants of\\nthe box looked up in surprise at Archer\\'s entrance.  He had already\\nbroken one of the rules of his world, which forbade the entering of a\\nbox during a solo.\\n\\nSlipping between Mr. van der Luyden and Sillerton Jackson, he leaned\\nover his wife.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got a beastly headache; don\\'t tell any one, but come home, won\\'t\\nyou?\" he whispered.\\n\\nMay gave him a glance of comprehension, and he saw her whisper to his\\nmother, who nodded sympathetically; then she murmured an excuse to Mrs.\\nvan der Luyden, and rose from her seat just as Marguerite fell into\\nFaust\\'s arms.  Archer, while he helped her on with her Opera cloak,\\nnoticed the exchange of a significant smile between the older ladies.\\n\\nAs they drove away May laid her hand shyly on his.  \"I\\'m so sorry you\\ndon\\'t feel well.  I\\'m afraid they\\'ve been overworking you again at the\\noffice.\"\\n\\n\"No--it\\'s not that: do you mind if I open the window?\" he returned\\nconfusedly, letting down the pane on his side.  He sat staring out into\\nthe street, feeling his wife beside him as a silent watchful\\ninterrogation, and keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the passing\\nhouses.  At their door she caught her skirt in the step of the\\ncarriage, and fell against him.\\n\\n\"Did you hurt yourself?\" he asked, steadying her with his arm.\\n\\n\"No; but my poor dress--see how I\\'ve torn it!\" she exclaimed.  She bent\\nto gather up a mud-stained breadth, and followed him up the steps into\\nthe hall.  The servants had not expected them so early, and there was\\nonly a glimmer of gas on the upper landing.\\n\\nArcher mounted the stairs, turned up the light, and put a match to the\\nbrackets on each side of the library mantelpiece.  The curtains were\\ndrawn, and the warm friendly aspect of the room smote him like that of\\na familiar face met during an unavowable errand.\\n\\nHe noticed that his wife was very pale, and asked if he should get her\\nsome brandy.\\n\\n\"Oh, no,\" she exclaimed with a momentary flush, as she took off her\\ncloak.  \"But hadn\\'t you better go to bed at once?\" she added, as he\\nopened a silver box on the table and took out a cigarette.\\n\\nArcher threw down the cigarette and walked to his usual place by the\\nfire.\\n\\n\"No; my head is not as bad as that.\"  He paused.  \"And there\\'s\\nsomething I want to say; something important--that I must tell you at\\nonce.\"\\n\\nShe had dropped into an armchair, and raised her head as he spoke.\\n\"Yes, dear?\" she rejoined, so gently that he wondered at the lack of\\nwonder with which she received this preamble.\\n\\n\"May--\" he began, standing a few feet from her chair, and looking over\\nat her as if the slight distance between them were an unbridgeable\\nabyss.  The sound of his voice echoed uncannily through the homelike\\nhush, and he repeated:  \"There is something I\\'ve got to tell you ...\\nabout myself ...\"\\n\\nShe sat silent, without a movement or a tremor of her lashes.  She was\\nstill extremely pale, but her face had a curious tranquillity of\\nexpression that seemed drawn from some secret inner source.\\n\\nArcher checked the conventional phrases of self-accusal that were\\ncrowding to his lips.  He was determined to put the case baldly,\\nwithout vain recrimination or excuse.\\n\\n\"Madame Olenska--\" he said; but at the name his wife raised her hand as\\nif to silence him.  As she did so the gaslight struck on the gold of\\nher wedding-ring.\\n\\n\"Oh, why should we talk about Ellen tonight?\" she asked, with a slight\\npout of impatience.\\n\\n\"Because I ought to have spoken before.\"\\n\\nHer face remained calm.  \"Is it really worth while, dear?  I know I\\'ve\\nbeen unfair to her at times--perhaps we all have.  You\\'ve understood\\nher, no doubt, better than we did: you\\'ve always been kind to her.  But\\nwhat does it matter, now it\\'s all over?\"\\n\\nArcher looked at her blankly.  Could it be possible that the sense of\\nunreality in which he felt himself imprisoned had communicated itself\\nto his wife?\\n\\n\"All over--what do you mean?\" he asked in an indistinct stammer.\\n\\nMay still looked at him with transparent eyes.  \"Why--since she\\'s going\\nback to Europe so soon; since Granny approves and understands, and has\\narranged to make her independent of her husband--\"\\n\\nShe broke off, and Archer, grasping the corner of the mantelpiece in\\none convulsed hand, and steadying himself against it, made a vain\\neffort to extend the same control to his reeling thoughts.\\n\\n\"I supposed,\" he heard his wife\\'s even voice go on, \"that you had been\\nkept at the office this evening about the business arrangements.  It\\nwas settled this morning, I believe.\"  She lowered her eyes under his\\nunseeing stare, and another fugitive flush passed over her face.\\n\\nHe understood that his own eyes must be unbearable, and turning away,\\nrested his elbows on the mantel-shelf and covered his face.  Something\\ndrummed and clanged furiously in his ears; he could not tell if it were\\nthe blood in his veins, or the tick of the clock on the mantel.\\n\\nMay sat without moving or speaking while the clock slowly measured out\\nfive minutes.  A lump of coal fell forward in the grate, and hearing\\nher rise to push it back, Archer at length turned and faced her.\\n\\n\"It\\'s impossible,\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n\"Impossible--?\"\\n\\n\"How do you know--what you\\'ve just told me?\"\\n\\n\"I saw Ellen yesterday--I told you I\\'d seen her at Granny\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"It wasn\\'t then that she told you?\"\\n\\n\"No; I had a note from her this afternoon.--Do you want to see it?\"\\n\\nHe could not find his voice, and she went out of the room, and came\\nback almost immediately.\\n\\n\"I thought you knew,\" she said simply.\\n\\nShe laid a sheet of paper on the table, and Archer put out his hand and\\ntook it up.  The letter contained only a few lines.\\n\\n\"May dear, I have at last made Granny understand that my visit to her\\ncould be no more than a visit; and she has been as kind and generous as\\never.  She sees now that if I return to Europe I must live by myself,\\nor rather with poor Aunt Medora, who is coming with me. I am hurrying\\nback to Washington to pack up, and we sail next week.  You must be very\\ngood to Granny when I\\'m gone--as good as you\\'ve always been to me.\\nEllen.\\n\\n\"If any of my friends wish to urge me to change my mind, please tell\\nthem it would be utterly useless.\"\\n\\nArcher read the letter over two or three times; then he flung it down\\nand burst out laughing.\\n\\nThe sound of his laugh startled him.  It recalled Janey\\'s midnight\\nfright when she had caught him rocking with incomprehensible mirth over\\nMay\\'s telegram announcing that the date of their marriage had been\\nadvanced.\\n\\n\"Why did she write this?\" he asked, checking his laugh with a supreme\\neffort.\\n\\nMay met the question with her unshaken candour.  \"I suppose because we\\ntalked things over yesterday--\"\\n\\n\"What things?\"\\n\\n\"I told her I was afraid I hadn\\'t been fair to her--hadn\\'t always\\nunderstood how hard it must have been for her here, alone among so many\\npeople who were relations and yet strangers; who felt the right to\\ncriticise, and yet didn\\'t always know the circumstances.\" She paused.\\n\"I knew you\\'d been the one friend she could always count on; and I\\nwanted her to know that you and I were the same--in all our feelings.\"\\n\\nShe hesitated, as if waiting for him to speak, and then added slowly:\\n\"She understood my wishing to tell her this.  I think she understands\\neverything.\"\\n\\nShe went up to Archer, and taking one of his cold hands pressed it\\nquickly against her cheek.\\n\\n\"My head aches too; good-night, dear,\" she said, and turned to the\\ndoor, her torn and muddy wedding-dress dragging after her across the\\nroom.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nArcher had been stunned by old Catherine\\'s news.  It was only natural\\nthat Madame Olenska should have hastened from Washington in response to\\nher grandmother\\'s summons; but that she should have decided to remain\\nunder her roof--especially now that Mrs. Mingott had almost regained\\nher health--was less easy to explain.\\n\\nArcher was sure that Madame Olenska\\'s decision had not been influenced\\nby the change in her financial situation.  He knew the exact figure of\\nthe small income which her husband had allowed her at their separation.\\nWithout the addition of her grandmother\\'s allowance it was hardly\\nenough to live on, in any sense known to the Mingott vocabulary; and\\nnow that Medora Manson, who shared her life, had been ruined, such a\\npittance would barely keep the two women clothed and fed.  Yet Archer\\nwas convinced that Madame Olenska had not accepted her grandmother\\'s\\noffer from interested motives.\\n\\nShe had the heedless generosity and the spasmodic extravagance of\\npersons used to large fortunes, and indifferent to money; but she could\\ngo without many things which her relations considered indispensable,\\nand Mrs. Lovell Mingott and Mrs. Welland had often been heard to\\ndeplore that any one who had enjoyed the cosmopolitan luxuries of Count\\nOlenski\\'s establishments should care so little about \"how things were\\ndone.\"  Moreover, as Archer knew, several months had passed since her\\nallowance had been cut off; yet in the interval she had made no effort\\nto regain her grandmother\\'s favour.  Therefore if she had changed her\\ncourse it must be for a different reason.\\n\\nHe did not have far to seek for that reason.  On the way from the ferry\\nshe had told him that he and she must remain apart; but she had said it\\nwith her head on his breast.  He knew that there was no calculated\\ncoquetry in her words; she was fighting her fate as he had fought his,\\nand clinging desperately to her resolve that they should not break\\nfaith with the people who trusted them.  But during the ten days which\\nhad elapsed since her return to New York she had perhaps guessed from\\nhis silence, and from the fact of his making no attempt to see her,\\nthat he was meditating a decisive step, a step from which there was no\\nturning back.  At the thought, a sudden fear of her own weakness might\\nhave seized her, and she might have felt that, after all, it was better\\nto accept the compromise usual in such cases, and follow the line of\\nleast resistance.\\n\\nAn hour earlier, when he had rung Mrs. Mingott\\'s bell, Archer had\\nfancied that his path was clear before him.  He had meant to have a\\nword alone with Madame Olenska, and failing that, to learn from her\\ngrandmother on what day, and by which train, she was returning to\\nWashington.  In that train he intended to join her, and travel with her\\nto Washington, or as much farther as she was willing to go.  His own\\nfancy inclined to Japan.  At any rate she would understand at once\\nthat, wherever she went, he was going.  He meant to leave a note for\\nMay that should cut off any other alternative.\\n\\nHe had fancied himself not only nerved for this plunge but eager to\\ntake it; yet his first feeling on hearing that the course of events was\\nchanged had been one of relief.  Now, however, as he walked home from\\nMrs. Mingott\\'s, he was conscious of a growing distaste for what lay\\nbefore him.  There was nothing unknown or unfamiliar in the path he was\\npresumably to tread; but when he had trodden it before it was as a free\\nman, who was accountable to no one for his actions, and could lend\\nhimself with an amused detachment to the game of precautions and\\nprevarications, concealments and compliances, that the part required.\\nThis procedure was called \"protecting a woman\\'s honour\"; and the best\\nfiction, combined with the after-dinner talk of his elders, had long\\nsince initiated him into every detail of its code.\\n\\nNow he saw the matter in a new light, and his part in it seemed\\nsingularly diminished.  It was, in fact, that which, with a secret\\nfatuity, he had watched Mrs. Thorley Rushworth play toward a fond and\\nunperceiving husband: a smiling, bantering, humouring, watchful and\\nincessant lie.  A lie by day, a lie by night, a lie in every touch and\\nevery look; a lie in every caress and every quarrel; a lie in every\\nword and in every silence.\\n\\nIt was easier, and less dastardly on the whole, for a wife to play such\\na part toward her husband.  A woman\\'s standard of truthfulness was\\ntacitly held to be lower: she was the subject creature, and versed in\\nthe arts of the enslaved.  Then she could always plead moods and\\nnerves, and the right not to be held too strictly to account; and even\\nin the most strait-laced societies the laugh was always against the\\nhusband.\\n\\nBut in Archer\\'s little world no one laughed at a wife deceived, and a\\ncertain measure of contempt was attached to men who continued their\\nphilandering after marriage.  In the rotation of crops there was a\\nrecognised season for wild oats; but they were not to be sown more than\\nonce.\\n\\nArcher had always shared this view: in his heart he thought Lefferts\\ndespicable.  But to love Ellen Olenska was not to become a man like\\nLefferts: for the first time Archer found himself face to face with the\\ndread argument of the individual case.  Ellen Olenska was like no other\\nwoman, he was like no other man: their situation, therefore, resembled\\nno one else\\'s, and they were answerable to no tribunal but that of\\ntheir own judgment.\\n\\nYes, but in ten minutes more he would be mounting his own doorstep; and\\nthere were May, and habit, and honour, and all the old decencies that\\nhe and his people had always believed in ...\\n\\nAt his corner he hesitated, and then walked on down Fifth Avenue.\\n\\nAhead of him, in the winter night, loomed a big unlit house.  As he\\ndrew near he thought how often he had seen it blazing with lights, its\\nsteps awninged and carpeted, and carriages waiting in double line to\\ndraw up at the curbstone.  It was in the conservatory that stretched\\nits dead-black bulk down the side street that he had taken his first\\nkiss from May; it was under the myriad candles of the ball-room that he\\nhad seen her appear, tall and silver-shining as a young Diana.\\n\\nNow the house was as dark as the grave, except for a faint flare of gas\\nin the basement, and a light in one upstairs room where the blind had\\nnot been lowered.  As Archer reached the corner he saw that the\\ncarriage standing at the door was Mrs. Manson Mingott\\'s.  What an\\nopportunity for Sillerton Jackson, if he should chance to pass!  Archer\\nhad been greatly moved by old Catherine\\'s account of Madame Olenska\\'s\\nattitude toward Mrs. Beaufort; it made the righteous reprobation of New\\nYork seem like a passing by on the other side.  But he knew well enough\\nwhat construction the clubs and drawing-rooms would put on Ellen\\nOlenska\\'s visits to her cousin.\\n\\nHe paused and looked up at the lighted window.  No doubt the two women\\nwere sitting together in that room: Beaufort had probably sought\\nconsolation elsewhere.  There were even rumours that he had left New\\nYork with Fanny Ring; but Mrs. Beaufort\\'s attitude made the report seem\\nimprobable.\\n\\nArcher had the nocturnal perspective of Fifth Avenue almost to himself.\\nAt that hour most people were indoors, dressing for dinner; and he was\\nsecretly glad that Ellen\\'s exit was likely to be unobserved.  As the\\nthought passed through his mind the door opened, and she came out.\\nBehind her was a faint light, such as might have been carried down the\\nstairs to show her the way.  She turned to say a word to some one; then\\nthe door closed, and she came down the steps.\\n\\n\"Ellen,\" he said in a low voice, as she reached the pavement.\\n\\nShe stopped with a slight start, and just then he saw two young men of\\nfashionable cut approaching.  There was a familiar air about their\\novercoats and the way their smart silk mufflers were folded over their\\nwhite ties; and he wondered how youths of their quality happened to be\\ndining out so early.  Then he remembered that the Reggie Chiverses,\\nwhose house was a few doors above, were taking a large party that\\nevening to see Adelaide Neilson in Romeo and Juliet, and guessed that\\nthe two were of the number.  They passed under a lamp, and he\\nrecognised Lawrence Lefferts and a young Chivers.\\n\\nA mean desire not to have Madame Olenska seen at the Beauforts\\' door\\nvanished as he felt the penetrating warmth of her hand.\\n\\n\"I shall see you now--we shall be together,\" he broke out, hardly\\nknowing what he said.\\n\\n\"Ah,\" she answered, \"Granny has told you?\"\\n\\nWhile he watched her he was aware that Lefferts and Chivers, on\\nreaching the farther side of the street corner, had discreetly struck\\naway across Fifth Avenue.  It was the kind of masculine solidarity that\\nhe himself often practised; now he sickened at their connivance.  Did\\nshe really imagine that he and she could live like this?  And if not,\\nwhat else did she imagine?\\n\\n\"Tomorrow I must see you--somewhere where we can be alone,\" he said, in\\na voice that sounded almost angry to his own ears.\\n\\nShe wavered, and moved toward the carriage.\\n\\n\"But I shall be at Granny\\'s--for the present that is,\" she added, as if\\nconscious that her change of plans required some explanation.\\n\\n\"Somewhere where we can be alone,\" he insisted.\\n\\nShe gave a faint laugh that grated on him.\\n\\n\"In New York?  But there are no churches ... no monuments.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s the Art Museum--in the Park,\" he explained, as she looked\\npuzzled.  \"At half-past two.  I shall be at the door ...\"\\n\\nShe turned away without answering and got quickly into the carriage.\\nAs it drove off she leaned forward, and he thought she waved her hand\\nin the obscurity.  He stared after her in a turmoil of contradictory\\nfeelings.  It seemed to him that he had been speaking not to the woman\\nhe loved but to another, a woman he was indebted to for pleasures\\nalready wearied of: it was hateful to find himself the prisoner of this\\nhackneyed vocabulary.\\n\\n\"She\\'ll come!\" he said to himself, almost contemptuously.\\n\\nAvoiding the popular \"Wolfe collection,\" whose anecdotic canvases\\nfilled one of the main galleries of the queer wilderness of cast-iron\\nand encaustic tiles known as the Metropolitan Museum, they had wandered\\ndown a passage to the room where the \"Cesnola antiquities\" mouldered in\\nunvisited loneliness.\\n\\nThey had this melancholy retreat to themselves, and seated on the divan\\nenclosing the central steam-radiator, they were staring silently at the\\nglass cabinets mounted in ebonised wood which contained the recovered\\nfragments of Ilium.\\n\\n\"It\\'s odd,\" Madame Olenska said, \"I never came here before.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, well--.  Some day, I suppose, it will be a great Museum.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she assented absently.\\n\\nShe stood up and wandered across the room.  Archer, remaining seated,\\nwatched the light movements of her figure, so girlish even under its\\nheavy furs, the cleverly planted heron wing in her fur cap, and the way\\na dark curl lay like a flattened vine spiral on each cheek above the\\near.  His mind, as always when they first met, was wholly absorbed in\\nthe delicious details that made her herself and no other.  Presently he\\nrose and approached the case before which she stood.  Its glass shelves\\nwere crowded with small broken objects--hardly recognisable domestic\\nutensils, ornaments and personal trifles--made of glass, of clay, of\\ndiscoloured bronze and other time-blurred substances.\\n\\n\"It seems cruel,\" she said, \"that after a while nothing matters ... any\\nmore than these little things, that used to be necessary and important\\nto forgotten people, and now have to be guessed at under a magnifying\\nglass and labelled:  \\'Use unknown.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but meanwhile--\"\\n\\n\"Ah, meanwhile--\"\\n\\nAs she stood there, in her long sealskin coat, her hands thrust in a\\nsmall round muff, her veil drawn down like a transparent mask to the\\ntip of her nose, and the bunch of violets he had brought her stirring\\nwith her quickly-taken breath, it seemed incredible that this pure\\nharmony of line and colour should ever suffer the stupid law of change.\\n\\n\"Meanwhile everything matters--that concerns you,\" he said.\\n\\nShe looked at him thoughtfully, and turned back to the divan.  He sat\\ndown beside her and waited; but suddenly he heard a step echoing far\\noff down the empty rooms, and felt the pressure of the minutes.\\n\\n\"What is it you wanted to tell me?\" she asked, as if she had received\\nthe same warning.\\n\\n\"What I wanted to tell you?\" he rejoined.  \"Why, that I believe you\\ncame to New York because you were afraid.\"\\n\\n\"Afraid?\"\\n\\n\"Of my coming to Washington.\"\\n\\nShe looked down at her muff, and he saw her hands stir in it uneasily.\\n\\n\"Well--?\"\\n\\n\"Well--yes,\" she said.\\n\\n\"You WERE afraid?  You knew--?\"\\n\\n\"Yes: I knew ...\"\\n\\n\"Well, then?\" he insisted.\\n\\n\"Well, then: this is better, isn\\'t it?\" she returned with a long\\nquestioning sigh.\\n\\n\"Better--?\"\\n\\n\"We shall hurt others less.  Isn\\'t it, after all, what you always\\nwanted?\"\\n\\n\"To have you here, you mean--in reach and yet out of reach?  To meet\\nyou in this way, on the sly?  It\\'s the very reverse of what I want.  I\\ntold you the other day what I wanted.\"\\n\\nShe hesitated.  \"And you still think this--worse?\"\\n\\n\"A thousand times!\"  He paused.  \"It would be easy to lie to you; but\\nthe truth is I think it detestable.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, so do I!\" she cried with a deep breath of relief.\\n\\nHe sprang up impatiently.  \"Well, then--it\\'s my turn to ask: what is\\nit, in God\\'s name, that you think better?\"\\n\\nShe hung her head and continued to clasp and unclasp her hands in her\\nmuff.  The step drew nearer, and a guardian in a braided cap walked\\nlistlessly through the room like a ghost stalking through a necropolis.\\nThey fixed their eyes simultaneously on the case opposite them, and\\nwhen the official figure had vanished down a vista of mummies and\\nsarcophagi Archer spoke again.\\n\\n\"What do you think better?\"\\n\\nInstead of answering she murmured:  \"I promised Granny to stay with her\\nbecause it seemed to me that here I should be safer.\"\\n\\n\"From me?\"\\n\\nShe bent her head slightly, without looking at him.\\n\\n\"Safer from loving me?\"\\n\\nHer profile did not stir, but he saw a tear overflow on her lashes and\\nhang in a mesh of her veil.\\n\\n\"Safer from doing irreparable harm.  Don\\'t let us be like all the\\nothers!\" she protested.\\n\\n\"What others?  I don\\'t profess to be different from my kind.  I\\'m\\nconsumed by the same wants and the same longings.\"\\n\\nShe glanced at him with a kind of terror, and he saw a faint colour\\nsteal into her cheeks.\\n\\n\"Shall I--once come to you; and then go home?\" she suddenly hazarded in\\na low clear voice.\\n\\nThe blood rushed to the young man\\'s forehead.  \"Dearest!\" he said,\\nwithout moving.  It seemed as if he held his heart in his hands, like a\\nfull cup that the least motion might overbrim.\\n\\nThen her last phrase struck his ear and his face clouded.  \"Go home?\\nWhat do you mean by going home?\"\\n\\n\"Home to my husband.\"\\n\\n\"And you expect me to say yes to that?\"\\n\\nShe raised her troubled eyes to his.  \"What else is there?  I can\\'t\\nstay here and lie to the people who\\'ve been good to me.\"\\n\\n\"But that\\'s the very reason why I ask you to come away!\"\\n\\n\"And destroy their lives, when they\\'ve helped me to remake mine?\"\\n\\nArcher sprang to his feet and stood looking down on her in inarticulate\\ndespair.  It would have been easy to say:  \"Yes, come; come once.\"  He\\nknew the power she would put in his hands if she consented; there would\\nbe no difficulty then in persuading her not to go back to her husband.\\n\\nBut something silenced the word on his lips.  A sort of passionate\\nhonesty in her made it inconceivable that he should try to draw her\\ninto that familiar trap.  \"If I were to let her come,\" he said to\\nhimself, \"I should have to let her go again.\"  And that was not to be\\nimagined.\\n\\nBut he saw the shadow of the lashes on her wet cheek, and wavered.\\n\\n\"After all,\" he began again, \"we have lives of our own....  There\\'s no\\nuse attempting the impossible.  You\\'re so unprejudiced about some\\nthings, so used, as you say, to looking at the Gorgon, that I don\\'t\\nknow why you\\'re afraid to face our case, and see it as it really\\nis--unless you think the sacrifice is not worth making.\"\\n\\nShe stood up also, her lips tightening under a rapid frown.\\n\\n\"Call it that, then--I must go,\" she said, drawing her little watch\\nfrom her bosom.\\n\\nShe turned away, and he followed and caught her by the wrist.  \"Well,\\nthen: come to me once,\" he said, his head turning suddenly at the\\nthought of losing her; and for a second or two they looked at each\\nother almost like enemies.\\n\\n\"When?\" he insisted.  \"Tomorrow?\"\\n\\nShe hesitated.  \"The day after.\"\\n\\n\"Dearest--!\" he said again.\\n\\nShe had disengaged her wrist; but for a moment they continued to hold\\neach other\\'s eyes, and he saw that her face, which had grown very pale,\\nwas flooded with a deep inner radiance.  His heart beat with awe: he\\nfelt that he had never before beheld love visible.\\n\\n\"Oh, I shall be late--good-bye.  No, don\\'t come any farther than this,\"\\nshe cried, walking hurriedly away down the long room, as if the\\nreflected radiance in his eyes had frightened her.  When she reached\\nthe door she turned for a moment to wave a quick farewell.\\n\\nArcher walked home alone.  Darkness was falling when he let himself\\ninto his house, and he looked about at the familiar objects in the hall\\nas if he viewed them from the other side of the grave.\\n\\nThe parlour-maid, hearing his step, ran up the stairs to light the gas\\non the upper landing.\\n\\n\"Is Mrs. Archer in?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir; Mrs. Archer went out in the carriage after luncheon, and\\nhasn\\'t come back.\"\\n\\nWith a sense of relief he entered the library and flung himself down in\\nhis armchair.  The parlour-maid followed, bringing the student lamp and\\nshaking some coals onto the dying fire.  When she left he continued to\\nsit motionless, his elbows on his knees, his chin on his clasped hands,\\nhis eyes fixed on the red grate.\\n\\nHe sat there without conscious thoughts, without sense of the lapse of\\ntime, in a deep and grave amazement that seemed to suspend life rather\\nthan quicken it.  \"This was what had to be, then ... this was what had\\nto be,\" he kept repeating to himself, as if he hung in the clutch of\\ndoom.  What he had dreamed of had been so different that there was a\\nmortal chill in his rapture.\\n\\nThe door opened and May came in.\\n\\n\"I\\'m dreadfully late--you weren\\'t worried, were you?\" she asked, laying\\nher hand on his shoulder with one of her rare caresses.\\n\\nHe looked up astonished.  \"Is it late?\"\\n\\n\"After seven.  I believe you\\'ve been asleep!\"  She laughed, and drawing\\nout her hat pins tossed her velvet hat on the sofa.  She looked paler\\nthan usual, but sparkling with an unwonted animation.\\n\\n\"I went to see Granny, and just as I was going away Ellen came in from\\na walk; so I stayed and had a long talk with her.  It was ages since\\nwe\\'d had a real talk....\" She had dropped into her usual armchair,\\nfacing his, and was running her fingers through her rumpled hair.  He\\nfancied she expected him to speak.\\n\\n\"A really good talk,\" she went on, smiling with what seemed to Archer\\nan unnatural vividness.  \"She was so dear--just like the old Ellen.\\nI\\'m afraid I haven\\'t been fair to her lately.  I\\'ve sometimes thought--\"\\n\\nArcher stood up and leaned against the mantelpiece, out of the radius\\nof the lamp.\\n\\n\"Yes, you\\'ve thought--?\" he echoed as she paused.\\n\\n\"Well, perhaps I haven\\'t judged her fairly.  She\\'s so different--at\\nleast on the surface.  She takes up such odd people--she seems to like\\nto make herself conspicuous.  I suppose it\\'s the life she\\'s led in that\\nfast European society; no doubt we seem dreadfully dull to her.  But I\\ndon\\'t want to judge her unfairly.\"\\n\\nShe paused again, a little breathless with the unwonted length of her\\nspeech, and sat with her lips slightly parted and a deep blush on her\\ncheeks.\\n\\nArcher, as he looked at her, was reminded of the glow which had\\nsuffused her face in the Mission Garden at St. Augustine.  He became\\naware of the same obscure effort in her, the same reaching out toward\\nsomething beyond the usual range of her vision.\\n\\n\"She hates Ellen,\" he thought, \"and she\\'s trying to overcome the\\nfeeling, and to get me to help her to overcome it.\"\\n\\nThe thought moved him, and for a moment he was on the point of breaking\\nthe silence between them, and throwing himself on her mercy.\\n\\n\"You understand, don\\'t you,\" she went on, \"why the family have\\nsometimes been annoyed?  We all did what we could for her at first; but\\nshe never seemed to understand.  And now this idea of going to see Mrs.\\nBeaufort, of going there in Granny\\'s carriage!  I\\'m afraid she\\'s quite\\nalienated the van der Luydens ...\"\\n\\n\"Ah,\" said Archer with an impatient laugh.  The open door had closed\\nbetween them again.\\n\\n\"It\\'s time to dress; we\\'re dining out, aren\\'t we?\" he asked, moving\\nfrom the fire.\\n\\nShe rose also, but lingered near the hearth.  As he walked past her she\\nmoved forward impulsively, as though to detain him: their eyes met, and\\nhe saw that hers were of the same swimming blue as when he had left her\\nto drive to Jersey City.\\n\\nShe flung her arms about his neck and pressed her cheek to his.\\n\\n\"You haven\\'t kissed me today,\" she said in a whisper; and he felt her\\ntremble in his arms.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nHis wife\\'s dark blue brougham (with the wedding varnish still on it)\\nmet Archer at the ferry, and conveyed him luxuriously to the\\nPennsylvania terminus in Jersey City.\\n\\nIt was a sombre snowy afternoon, and the gas-lamps were lit in the big\\nreverberating station.  As he paced the platform, waiting for the\\nWashington express, he remembered that there were people who thought\\nthere would one day be a tunnel under the Hudson through which the\\ntrains of the Pennsylvania railway would run straight into New York.\\nThey were of the brotherhood of visionaries who likewise predicted the\\nbuilding of ships that would cross the Atlantic in five days, the\\ninvention of a flying machine, lighting by electricity, telephonic\\ncommunication without wires, and other Arabian Night marvels.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care which of their visions comes true,\" Archer mused, \"as\\nlong as the tunnel isn\\'t built yet.\"  In his senseless school-boy\\nhappiness he pictured Madame Olenska\\'s descent from the train, his\\ndiscovery of her a long way off, among the throngs of meaningless\\nfaces, her clinging to his arm as he guided her to the carriage, their\\nslow approach to the wharf among slipping horses, laden carts,\\nvociferating teamsters, and then the startling quiet of the ferry-boat,\\nwhere they would sit side by side under the snow, in the motionless\\ncarriage, while the earth seemed to glide away under them, rolling to\\nthe other side of the sun.  It was incredible, the number of things he\\nhad to say to her, and in what eloquent order they were forming\\nthemselves on his lips ...\\n\\nThe clanging and groaning of the train came nearer, and it staggered\\nslowly into the station like a prey-laden monster into its lair.\\nArcher pushed forward, elbowing through the crowd, and staring blindly\\ninto window after window of the high-hung carriages.  And then,\\nsuddenly, he saw Madame Olenska\\'s pale and surprised face close at\\nhand, and had again the mortified sensation of having forgotten what\\nshe looked like.\\n\\nThey reached each other, their hands met, and he drew her arm through\\nhis.  \"This way--I have the carriage,\" he said.\\n\\nAfter that it all happened as he had dreamed.  He helped her into the\\nbrougham with her bags, and had afterward the vague recollection of\\nhaving properly reassured her about her grandmother and given her a\\nsummary of the Beaufort situation (he was struck by the softness of\\nher:  \"Poor Regina!\").  Meanwhile the carriage had worked its way out\\nof the coil about the station, and they were crawling down the slippery\\nincline to the wharf, menaced by swaying coal-carts, bewildered horses,\\ndishevelled express-wagons, and an empty hearse--ah, that hearse!  She\\nshut her eyes as it passed, and clutched at Archer\\'s hand.\\n\\n\"If only it doesn\\'t mean--poor Granny!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, no--she\\'s much better--she\\'s all right, really.  There--we\\'ve\\npassed it!\" he exclaimed, as if that made all the difference.  Her hand\\nremained in his, and as the carriage lurched across the gang-plank onto\\nthe ferry he bent over, unbuttoned her tight brown glove, and kissed\\nher palm as if he had kissed a relic.  She disengaged herself with a\\nfaint smile, and he said: \"You didn\\'t expect me today?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no.\"\\n\\n\"I meant to go to Washington to see you.  I\\'d made all my\\narrangements--I very nearly crossed you in the train.\"\\n\\n\"Oh--\" she exclaimed, as if terrified by the narrowness of their escape.\\n\\n\"Do you know--I hardly remembered you?\"\\n\\n\"Hardly remembered me?\"\\n\\n\"I mean: how shall I explain?  I--it\\'s always so.  EACH TIME YOU HAPPEN\\nTO ME ALL OVER AGAIN.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes: I know!  I know!\"\\n\\n\"Does it--do I too: to you?\" he insisted.\\n\\nShe nodded, looking out of the window.\\n\\n\"Ellen--Ellen--Ellen!\"\\n\\nShe made no answer, and he sat in silence, watching her profile grow\\nindistinct against the snow-streaked dusk beyond the window.  What had\\nshe been doing in all those four long months, he wondered?  How little\\nthey knew of each other, after all!  The precious moments were slipping\\naway, but he had forgotten everything that he had meant to say to her\\nand could only helplessly brood on the mystery of their remoteness and\\ntheir proximity, which seemed to be symbolised by the fact of their\\nsitting so close to each other, and yet being unable to see each\\nother\\'s faces.\\n\\n\"What a pretty carriage!  Is it May\\'s?\" she asked, suddenly turning her\\nface from the window.\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"It was May who sent you to fetch me, then?  How kind of her!\"\\n\\nHe made no answer for a moment; then he said explosively:  \"Your\\nhusband\\'s secretary came to see me the day after we met in Boston.\"\\n\\nIn his brief letter to her he had made no allusion to M. Riviere\\'s\\nvisit, and his intention had been to bury the incident in his bosom.\\nBut her reminder that they were in his wife\\'s carriage provoked him to\\nan impulse of retaliation.  He would see if she liked his reference to\\nRiviere any better than he liked hers to May!  As on certain other\\noccasions when he had expected to shake her out of her usual composure,\\nshe betrayed no sign of surprise: and at once he concluded:  \"He writes\\nto her, then.\"\\n\\n\"M. Riviere went to see you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes: didn\\'t you know?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" she answered simply.\\n\\n\"And you\\'re not surprised?\"\\n\\nShe hesitated.  \"Why should I be?  He told me in Boston that he knew\\nyou; that he\\'d met you in England I think.\"\\n\\n\"Ellen--I must ask you one thing.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"I wanted to ask it after I saw him, but I couldn\\'t put it in a letter.\\nIt was Riviere who helped you to get away--when you left your husband?\"\\n\\nHis heart was beating suffocatingly.  Would she meet this question with\\nthe same composure?\\n\\n\"Yes: I owe him a great debt,\" she answered, without the least tremor\\nin her quiet voice.\\n\\nHer tone was so natural, so almost indifferent, that Archer\\'s turmoil\\nsubsided.  Once more she had managed, by her sheer simplicity, to make\\nhim feel stupidly conventional just when he thought he was flinging\\nconvention to the winds.\\n\\n\"I think you\\'re the most honest woman I ever met!\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n\"Oh, no--but probably one of the least fussy,\" she answered, a smile in\\nher voice.\\n\\n\"Call it what you like: you look at things as they are.\"\\n\\n\"Ah--I\\'ve had to.  I\\'ve had to look at the Gorgon.\"\\n\\n\"Well--it hasn\\'t blinded you!  You\\'ve seen that she\\'s just an old bogey\\nlike all the others.\"\\n\\n\"She doesn\\'t blind one; but she dries up one\\'s tears.\"\\n\\nThe answer checked the pleading on Archer\\'s lips: it seemed to come\\nfrom depths of experience beyond his reach.  The slow advance of the\\nferry-boat had ceased, and her bows bumped against the piles of the\\nslip with a violence that made the brougham stagger, and flung Archer\\nand Madame Olenska against each other.  The young man, trembling, felt\\nthe pressure of her shoulder, and passed his arm about her.\\n\\n\"If you\\'re not blind, then, you must see that this can\\'t last.\"\\n\\n\"What can\\'t?\"\\n\\n\"Our being together--and not together.\"\\n\\n\"No.  You ought not to have come today,\" she said in an altered voice;\\nand suddenly she turned, flung her arms about him and pressed her lips\\nto his.  At the same moment the carriage began to move, and a gas-lamp\\nat the head of the slip flashed its light into the window.  She drew\\naway, and they sat silent and motionless while the brougham struggled\\nthrough the congestion of carriages about the ferry-landing.  As they\\ngained the street Archer began to speak hurriedly.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be afraid of me: you needn\\'t squeeze yourself back into your\\ncorner like that.  A stolen kiss isn\\'t what I want.  Look: I\\'m not even\\ntrying to touch the sleeve of your jacket.  Don\\'t suppose that I don\\'t\\nunderstand your reasons for not wanting to let this feeling between us\\ndwindle into an ordinary hole-and-corner love-affair.  I couldn\\'t have\\nspoken like this yesterday, because when we\\'ve been apart, and I\\'m\\nlooking forward to seeing you, every thought is burnt up in a great\\nflame.  But then you come; and you\\'re so much more than I remembered,\\nand what I want of you is so much more than an hour or two every now\\nand then, with wastes of thirsty waiting between, that I can sit\\nperfectly still beside you, like this, with that other vision in my\\nmind, just quietly trusting to it to come true.\"\\n\\nFor a moment she made no reply; then she asked, hardly above a whisper:\\n\"What do you mean by trusting to it to come true?\"\\n\\n\"Why--you know it will, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Your vision of you and me together?\"  She burst into a sudden hard\\nlaugh.  \"You choose your place well to put it to me!\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean because we\\'re in my wife\\'s brougham?  Shall we get out and\\nwalk, then?  I don\\'t suppose you mind a little snow?\"\\n\\nShe laughed again, more gently.  \"No; I shan\\'t get out and walk,\\nbecause my business is to get to Granny\\'s as quickly as I can.  And\\nyou\\'ll sit beside me, and we\\'ll look, not at visions, but at realities.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what you mean by realities.  The only reality to me is\\nthis.\"\\n\\nShe met the words with a long silence, during which the carriage rolled\\ndown an obscure side-street and then turned into the searching\\nillumination of Fifth Avenue.\\n\\n\"Is it your idea, then, that I should live with you as your\\nmistress--since I can\\'t be your wife?\" she asked.\\n\\nThe crudeness of the question startled him: the word was one that women\\nof his class fought shy of, even when their talk flitted closest about\\nthe topic.  He noticed that Madame Olenska pronounced it as if it had a\\nrecognised place in her vocabulary, and he wondered if it had been used\\nfamiliarly in her presence in the horrible life she had fled from.  Her\\nquestion pulled him up with a jerk, and he floundered.\\n\\n\"I want--I want somehow to get away with you into a world where words\\nlike that--categories like that--won\\'t exist.  Where we shall be simply\\ntwo human beings who love each other, who are the whole of life to each\\nother; and nothing else on earth will matter.\"\\n\\nShe drew a deep sigh that ended in another laugh.  \"Oh, my dear--where\\nis that country?  Have you ever been there?\" she asked; and as he\\nremained sullenly dumb she went on:  \"I know so many who\\'ve tried to\\nfind it; and, believe me, they all got out by mistake at wayside\\nstations: at places like Boulogne, or Pisa, or Monte Carlo--and it\\nwasn\\'t at all different from the old world they\\'d left, but only rather\\nsmaller and dingier and more promiscuous.\"\\n\\nHe had never heard her speak in such a tone, and he remembered the\\nphrase she had used a little while before.\\n\\n\"Yes, the Gorgon HAS dried your tears,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Well, she opened my eyes too; it\\'s a delusion to say that she blinds\\npeople.  What she does is just the contrary--she fastens their eyelids\\nopen, so that they\\'re never again in the blessed darkness.  Isn\\'t there\\na Chinese torture like that?  There ought to be.  Ah, believe me, it\\'s\\na miserable little country!\"\\n\\nThe carriage had crossed Forty-second Street: May\\'s sturdy\\nbrougham-horse was carrying them northward as if he had been a Kentucky\\ntrotter.  Archer choked with the sense of wasted minutes and vain words.\\n\\n\"Then what, exactly, is your plan for us?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"For US?  But there\\'s no US in that sense!  We\\'re near each other only\\nif we stay far from each other.  Then we can be ourselves.  Otherwise\\nwe\\'re only Newland Archer, the husband of Ellen Olenska\\'s cousin, and\\nEllen Olenska, the cousin of Newland Archer\\'s wife, trying to be happy\\nbehind the backs of the people who trust them.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, I\\'m beyond that,\" he groaned.\\n\\n\"No, you\\'re not!  You\\'ve never been beyond.  And I have,\" she said, in\\na strange voice, \"and I know what it looks like there.\"\\n\\nHe sat silent, dazed with inarticulate pain.  Then he groped in the\\ndarkness of the carriage for the little bell that signalled orders to\\nthe coachman.  He remembered that May rang twice when she wished to\\nstop.  He pressed the bell, and the carriage drew up beside the\\ncurbstone.\\n\\n\"Why are we stopping?  This is not Granny\\'s,\" Madame Olenska exclaimed.\\n\\n\"No: I shall get out here,\" he stammered, opening the door and jumping\\nto the pavement.  By the light of a street-lamp he saw her startled\\nface, and the instinctive motion she made to detain him.  He closed the\\ndoor, and leaned for a moment in the window.\\n\\n\"You\\'re right: I ought not to have come today,\" he said, lowering his\\nvoice so that the coachman should not hear.  She bent forward, and\\nseemed about to speak; but he had already called out the order to drive\\non, and the carriage rolled away while he stood on the corner.  The\\nsnow was over, and a tingling wind had sprung up, that lashed his face\\nas he stood gazing.  Suddenly he felt something stiff and cold on his\\nlashes, and perceived that he had been crying, and that the wind had\\nfrozen his tears.\\n\\nHe thrust his hands in his pockets, and walked at a sharp pace down\\nFifth Avenue to his own house.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nThat evening when Archer came down before dinner he found the\\ndrawing-room empty.\\n\\nHe and May were dining alone, all the family engagements having been\\npostponed since Mrs. Manson Mingott\\'s illness; and as May was the more\\npunctual of the two he was surprised that she had not preceded him.  He\\nknew that she was at home, for while he dressed he had heard her moving\\nabout in her room; and he wondered what had delayed her.\\n\\nHe had fallen into the way of dwelling on such conjectures as a means\\nof tying his thoughts fast to reality.  Sometimes he felt as if he had\\nfound the clue to his father-in-law\\'s absorption in trifles; perhaps\\neven Mr. Welland, long ago, had had escapes and visions, and had\\nconjured up all the hosts of domesticity to defend himself against them.\\n\\nWhen May appeared he thought she looked tired.  She had put on the\\nlow-necked and tightly-laced dinner-dress which the Mingott ceremonial\\nexacted on the most informal occasions, and had built her fair hair\\ninto its usual accumulated coils; and her face, in contrast, was wan\\nand almost faded.  But she shone on him with her usual tenderness, and\\nher eyes had kept the blue dazzle of the day before.\\n\\n\"What became of you, dear?\" she asked.  \"I was waiting at Granny\\'s, and\\nEllen came alone, and said she had dropped you on the way because you\\nhad to rush off on business.  There\\'s nothing wrong?\"\\n\\n\"Only some letters I\\'d forgotten, and wanted to get off before dinner.\"\\n\\n\"Ah--\" she said; and a moment afterward:  \"I\\'m sorry you didn\\'t come to\\nGranny\\'s--unless the letters were urgent.\"\\n\\n\"They were,\" he rejoined, surprised at her insistence.  \"Besides, I\\ndon\\'t see why I should have gone to your grandmother\\'s.  I didn\\'t know\\nyou were there.\"\\n\\nShe turned and moved to the looking-glass above the mantel-piece.  As\\nshe stood there, lifting her long arm to fasten a puff that had slipped\\nfrom its place in her intricate hair, Archer was struck by something\\nlanguid and inelastic in her attitude, and wondered if the deadly\\nmonotony of their lives had laid its weight on her also.  Then he\\nremembered that, as he had left the house that morning, she had called\\nover the stairs that she would meet him at her grandmother\\'s so that\\nthey might drive home together.  He had called back a cheery \"Yes!\" and\\nthen, absorbed in other visions, had forgotten his promise.  Now he was\\nsmitten with compunction, yet irritated that so trifling an omission\\nshould be stored up against him after nearly two years of marriage.  He\\nwas weary of living in a perpetual tepid honeymoon, without the\\ntemperature of passion yet with all its exactions.  If May had spoken\\nout her grievances (he suspected her of many) he might have laughed\\nthem away; but she was trained to conceal imaginary wounds under a\\nSpartan smile.\\n\\nTo disguise his own annoyance he asked how her grandmother was, and she\\nanswered that Mrs. Mingott was still improving, but had been rather\\ndisturbed by the last news about the Beauforts.\\n\\n\"What news?\"\\n\\n\"It seems they\\'re going to stay in New York.  I believe he\\'s going into\\nan insurance business, or something.  They\\'re looking about for a small\\nhouse.\"\\n\\nThe preposterousness of the case was beyond discussion, and they went\\nin to dinner.  During dinner their talk moved in its usual limited\\ncircle; but Archer noticed that his wife made no allusion to Madame\\nOlenska, nor to old Catherine\\'s reception of her.  He was thankful for\\nthe fact, yet felt it to be vaguely ominous.\\n\\nThey went up to the library for coffee, and Archer lit a cigar and took\\ndown a volume of Michelet.  He had taken to history in the evenings\\nsince May had shown a tendency to ask him to read aloud whenever she\\nsaw him with a volume of poetry: not that he disliked the sound of his\\nown voice, but because he could always foresee her comments on what he\\nread.  In the days of their engagement she had simply (as he now\\nperceived) echoed what he told her; but since he had ceased to provide\\nher with opinions she had begun to hazard her own, with results\\ndestructive to his enjoyment of the works commented on.\\n\\nSeeing that he had chosen history she fetched her workbasket, drew up\\nan arm-chair to the green-shaded student lamp, and uncovered a cushion\\nshe was embroidering for his sofa.  She was not a clever needle-woman;\\nher large capable hands were made for riding, rowing and open-air\\nactivities; but since other wives embroidered cushions for their\\nhusbands she did not wish to omit this last link in her devotion.\\n\\nShe was so placed that Archer, by merely raising his eyes, could see\\nher bent above her work-frame, her ruffled elbow-sleeves slipping back\\nfrom her firm round arms, the betrothal sapphire shining on her left\\nhand above her broad gold wedding-ring, and the right hand slowly and\\nlaboriously stabbing the canvas.  As she sat thus, the lamplight full\\non her clear brow, he said to himself with a secret dismay that he\\nwould always know the thoughts behind it, that never, in all the years\\nto come, would she surprise him by an unexpected mood, by a new idea, a\\nweakness, a cruelty or an emotion.  She had spent her poetry and\\nromance on their short courting: the function was exhausted because the\\nneed was past.  Now she was simply ripening into a copy of her mother,\\nand mysteriously, by the very process, trying to turn him into a Mr.\\nWelland.  He laid down his book and stood up impatiently; and at once\\nshe raised her head.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n\\n\"The room is stifling: I want a little air.\"\\n\\nHe had insisted that the library curtains should draw backward and\\nforward on a rod, so that they might be closed in the evening, instead\\nof remaining nailed to a gilt cornice, and immovably looped up over\\nlayers of lace, as in the drawing-room; and he pulled them back and\\npushed up the sash, leaning out into the icy night.  The mere fact of\\nnot looking at May, seated beside his table, under his lamp, the fact\\nof seeing other houses, roofs, chimneys, of getting the sense of other\\nlives outside his own, other cities beyond New York, and a whole world\\nbeyond his world, cleared his brain and made it easier to breathe.\\n\\nAfter he had leaned out into the darkness for a few minutes he heard\\nher say:  \"Newland!  Do shut the window.  You\\'ll catch your death.\"\\n\\nHe pulled the sash down and turned back.  \"Catch my death!\" he echoed;\\nand he felt like adding:  \"But I\\'ve caught it already.  I AM dead--I\\'ve\\nbeen dead for months and months.\"\\n\\nAnd suddenly the play of the word flashed up a wild suggestion.  What\\nif it were SHE who was dead!  If she were going to die--to die\\nsoon--and leave him free!  The sensation of standing there, in that\\nwarm familiar room, and looking at her, and wishing her dead, was so\\nstrange, so fascinating and overmastering, that its enormity did not\\nimmediately strike him.  He simply felt that chance had given him a new\\npossibility to which his sick soul might cling.  Yes, May might\\ndie--people did: young people, healthy people like herself: she might\\ndie, and set him suddenly free.\\n\\nShe glanced up, and he saw by her widening eyes that there must be\\nsomething strange in his own.\\n\\n\"Newland!  Are you ill?\"\\n\\nHe shook his head and turned toward his arm-chair.  She bent over her\\nwork-frame, and as he passed he laid his hand on her hair.  \"Poor May!\"\\nhe said.\\n\\n\"Poor?  Why poor?\" she echoed with a strained laugh.\\n\\n\"Because I shall never be able to open a window without worrying you,\"\\nhe rejoined, laughing also.\\n\\nFor a moment she was silent; then she said very low, her head bowed\\nover her work:  \"I shall never worry if you\\'re happy.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, my dear; and I shall never be happy unless I can open the windows!\"\\n\\n\"In THIS weather?\" she remonstrated; and with a sigh he buried his head\\nin his book.\\n\\nSix or seven days passed.  Archer heard nothing from Madame Olenska,\\nand became aware that her name would not be mentioned in his presence\\nby any member of the family.  He did not try to see her; to do so while\\nshe was at old Catherine\\'s guarded bedside would have been almost\\nimpossible.  In the uncertainty of the situation he let himself drift,\\nconscious, somewhere below the surface of his thoughts, of a resolve\\nwhich had come to him when he had leaned out from his library window\\ninto the icy night.  The strength of that resolve made it easy to wait\\nand make no sign.\\n\\nThen one day May told him that Mrs. Manson Mingott had asked to see\\nhim.  There was nothing surprising in the request, for the old lady was\\nsteadily recovering, and she had always openly declared that she\\npreferred Archer to any of her other grandsons-in-law.  May gave the\\nmessage with evident pleasure: she was proud of old Catherine\\'s\\nappreciation of her husband.\\n\\nThere was a moment\\'s pause, and then Archer felt it incumbent on him to\\nsay:  \"All right.  Shall we go together this afternoon?\"\\n\\nHis wife\\'s face brightened, but she instantly answered: \"Oh, you\\'d much\\nbetter go alone.  It bores Granny to see the same people too often.\"\\n\\nArcher\\'s heart was beating violently when he rang old Mrs. Mingott\\'s\\nbell.  He had wanted above all things to go alone, for he felt sure the\\nvisit would give him the chance of saying a word in private to the\\nCountess Olenska.  He had determined to wait till the chance presented\\nitself naturally; and here it was, and here he was on the doorstep.\\nBehind the door, behind the curtains of the yellow damask room next to\\nthe hall, she was surely awaiting him; in another moment he should see\\nher, and be able to speak to her before she led him to the sick-room.\\n\\nHe wanted only to put one question: after that his course would be\\nclear.  What he wished to ask was simply the date of her return to\\nWashington; and that question she could hardly refuse to answer.\\n\\nBut in the yellow sitting-room it was the mulatto maid who waited.  Her\\nwhite teeth shining like a keyboard, she pushed back the sliding doors\\nand ushered him into old Catherine\\'s presence.\\n\\nThe old woman sat in a vast throne-like arm-chair near her bed.  Beside\\nher was a mahogany stand bearing a cast bronze lamp with an engraved\\nglobe, over which a green paper shade had been balanced.  There was not\\na book or a newspaper in reach, nor any evidence of feminine\\nemployment: conversation had always been Mrs. Mingott\\'s sole pursuit,\\nand she would have scorned to feign an interest in fancywork.\\n\\nArcher saw no trace of the slight distortion left by her stroke.  She\\nmerely looked paler, with darker shadows in the folds and recesses of\\nher obesity; and, in the fluted mob-cap tied by a starched bow between\\nher first two chins, and the muslin kerchief crossed over her billowing\\npurple dressing-gown, she seemed like some shrewd and kindly ancestress\\nof her own who might have yielded too freely to the pleasures of the\\ntable.\\n\\nShe held out one of the little hands that nestled in a hollow of her\\nhuge lap like pet animals, and called to the maid:  \"Don\\'t let in any\\none else.  If my daughters call, say I\\'m asleep.\"\\n\\nThe maid disappeared, and the old lady turned to her grandson.\\n\\n\"My dear, am I perfectly hideous?\" she asked gaily, launching out one\\nhand in search of the folds of muslin on her inaccessible bosom.  \"My\\ndaughters tell me it doesn\\'t matter at my age--as if hideousness didn\\'t\\nmatter all the more the harder it gets to conceal!\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you\\'re handsomer than ever!\" Archer rejoined in the same\\ntone; and she threw back her head and laughed.\\n\\n\"Ah, but not as handsome as Ellen!\" she jerked out, twinkling at him\\nmaliciously; and before he could answer she added:  \"Was she so awfully\\nhandsome the day you drove her up from the ferry?\"\\n\\nHe laughed, and she continued:  \"Was it because you told her so that\\nshe had to put you out on the way?  In my youth young men didn\\'t desert\\npretty women unless they were made to!\"  She gave another chuckle, and\\ninterrupted it to say almost querulously:  \"It\\'s a pity she didn\\'t\\nmarry you; I always told her so.  It would have spared me all this\\nworry.  But who ever thought of sparing their grandmother worry?\"\\n\\nArcher wondered if her illness had blurred her faculties; but suddenly\\nshe broke out:  \"Well, it\\'s settled, anyhow: she\\'s going to stay with\\nme, whatever the rest of the family say!  She hadn\\'t been here five\\nminutes before I\\'d have gone down on my knees to keep her--if only, for\\nthe last twenty years, I\\'d been able to see where the floor was!\"\\n\\nArcher listened in silence, and she went on:  \"They\\'d talked me over,\\nas no doubt you know: persuaded me, Lovell, and Letterblair, and\\nAugusta Welland, and all the rest of them, that I must hold out and cut\\noff her allowance, till she was made to see that it was her duty to go\\nback to Olenski.  They thought they\\'d convinced me when the secretary,\\nor whatever he was, came out with the last proposals: handsome\\nproposals I confess they were.  After all, marriage is marriage, and\\nmoney\\'s money--both useful things in their way ... and I didn\\'t know\\nwhat to answer--\"  She broke off and drew a long breath, as if speaking\\nhad become an effort.  \"But the minute I laid eyes on her, I said:\\n\\'You sweet bird, you!  Shut you up in that cage again?  Never!\\'  And\\nnow it\\'s settled that she\\'s to stay here and nurse her Granny as long\\nas there\\'s a Granny to nurse.  It\\'s not a gay prospect, but she doesn\\'t\\nmind; and of course I\\'ve told Letterblair that she\\'s to be given her\\nproper allowance.\"\\n\\nThe young man heard her with veins aglow; but in his confusion of mind\\nhe hardly knew whether her news brought joy or pain.  He had so\\ndefinitely decided on the course he meant to pursue that for the moment\\nhe could not readjust his thoughts.  But gradually there stole over him\\nthe delicious sense of difficulties deferred and opportunities\\nmiraculously provided.  If Ellen had consented to come and live with\\nher grandmother it must surely be because she had recognised the\\nimpossibility of giving him up.  This was her answer to his final\\nappeal of the other day: if she would not take the extreme step he had\\nurged, she had at last yielded to half-measures.  He sank back into the\\nthought with the involuntary relief of a man who has been ready to risk\\neverything, and suddenly tastes the dangerous sweetness of security.\\n\\n\"She couldn\\'t have gone back--it was impossible!\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n\"Ah, my dear, I always knew you were on her side; and that\\'s why I sent\\nfor you today, and why I said to your pretty wife, when she proposed to\\ncome with you: \\'No, my dear, I\\'m pining to see Newland, and I don\\'t\\nwant anybody to share our transports.\\'  For you see, my dear--\" she\\ndrew her head back as far as its tethering chins permitted, and looked\\nhim full in the eyes--\"you see, we shall have a fight yet.  The family\\ndon\\'t want her here, and they\\'ll say it\\'s because I\\'ve been ill,\\nbecause I\\'m a weak old woman, that she\\'s persuaded me.  I\\'m not well\\nenough yet to fight them one by one, and you\\'ve got to do it for me.\"\\n\\n\"I?\" he stammered.\\n\\n\"You.  Why not?\" she jerked back at him, her round eyes suddenly as\\nsharp as pen-knives.  Her hand fluttered from its chair-arm and lit on\\nhis with a clutch of little pale nails like bird-claws.  \"Why not?\" she\\nsearchingly repeated.\\n\\nArcher, under the exposure of her gaze, had recovered his\\nself-possession.\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t count--I\\'m too insignificant.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you\\'re Letterblair\\'s partner, ain\\'t you?  You\\'ve got to get at\\nthem through Letterblair.  Unless you\\'ve got a reason,\" she insisted.\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear, I back you to hold your own against them all without my\\nhelp; but you shall have it if you need it,\" he reassured her.\\n\\n\"Then we\\'re safe!\" she sighed; and smiling on him with all her ancient\\ncunning she added, as she settled her head among the cushions:  \"I\\nalways knew you\\'d back us up, because they never quote you when they\\ntalk about its being her duty to go home.\"\\n\\nHe winced a little at her terrifying perspicacity, and longed to ask:\\n\"And May--do they quote her?\"  But he judged it safer to turn the\\nquestion.\\n\\n\"And Madame Olenska?  When am I to see her?\" he said.\\n\\nThe old lady chuckled, crumpled her lids, and went through the\\npantomime of archness.  \"Not today.  One at a time, please.  Madame\\nOlenska\\'s gone out.\"\\n\\nHe flushed with disappointment, and she went on: \"She\\'s gone out, my\\nchild: gone in my carriage to see Regina Beaufort.\"\\n\\nShe paused for this announcement to produce its effect.  \"That\\'s what\\nshe\\'s reduced me to already.  The day after she got here she put on her\\nbest bonnet, and told me, as cool as a cucumber, that she was going to\\ncall on Regina Beaufort.  \\'I don\\'t know her; who is she?\\' says I.\\n\\'She\\'s your grand-niece, and a most unhappy woman,\\' she says.  \\'She\\'s\\nthe wife of a scoundrel,\\' I answered.  \\'Well,\\' she says, \\'and so am I,\\nand yet all my family want me to go back to him.\\'  Well, that floored\\nme, and I let her go; and finally one day she said it was raining too\\nhard to go out on foot, and she wanted me to lend her my carriage.\\n\\'What for?\\' I asked her; and she said: \\'To go and see cousin\\nRegina\\'--COUSIN!  Now, my dear, I looked out of the window, and saw it\\nwasn\\'t raining a drop; but I understood her, and I let her have the\\ncarriage....  After all, Regina\\'s a brave woman, and so is she; and\\nI\\'ve always liked courage above everything.\"\\n\\nArcher bent down and pressed his lips on the little hand that still lay\\non his.\\n\\n\"Eh--eh--eh!  Whose hand did you think you were kissing, young\\nman--your wife\\'s, I hope?\" the old lady snapped out with her mocking\\ncackle; and as he rose to go she called out after him:  \"Give her her\\nGranny\\'s love; but you\\'d better not say anything about our talk.\"\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nIt was, as Mrs. Archer smilingly said to Mrs. Welland, a great event\\nfor a young couple to give their first big dinner.\\n\\nThe Newland Archers, since they had set up their household, had\\nreceived a good deal of company in an informal way.  Archer was fond of\\nhaving three or four friends to dine, and May welcomed them with the\\nbeaming readiness of which her mother had set her the example in\\nconjugal affairs.  Her husband questioned whether, if left to herself,\\nshe would ever have asked any one to the house; but he had long given\\nup trying to disengage her real self from the shape into which\\ntradition and training had moulded her.  It was expected that well-off\\nyoung couples in New York should do a good deal of informal\\nentertaining, and a Welland married to an Archer was doubly pledged to\\nthe tradition.\\n\\nBut a big dinner, with a hired chef and two borrowed footmen, with\\nRoman punch, roses from Henderson\\'s, and menus on gilt-edged cards, was\\na different affair, and not to be lightly undertaken.  As Mrs. Archer\\nremarked, the Roman punch made all the difference; not in itself but by\\nits manifold implications--since it signified either canvas-backs or\\nterrapin, two soups, a hot and a cold sweet, full decolletage with\\nshort sleeves, and guests of a proportionate importance.\\n\\nIt was always an interesting occasion when a young pair launched their\\nfirst invitations in the third person, and their summons was seldom\\nrefused even by the seasoned and sought-after.  Still, it was\\nadmittedly a triumph that the van der Luydens, at May\\'s request, should\\nhave stayed over in order to be present at her farewell dinner for the\\nCountess Olenska.\\n\\nThe two mothers-in-law sat in May\\'s drawing-room on the afternoon of\\nthe great day, Mrs. Archer writing out the menus on Tiffany\\'s thickest\\ngilt-edged bristol, while Mrs. Welland superintended the placing of the\\npalms and standard lamps.\\n\\nArcher, arriving late from his office, found them still there.  Mrs.\\nArcher had turned her attention to the name-cards for the table, and\\nMrs. Welland was considering the effect of bringing forward the large\\ngilt sofa, so that another \"corner\" might be created between the piano\\nand the window.\\n\\nMay, they told him, was in the dining-room inspecting the mound of\\nJacqueminot roses and maidenhair in the centre of the long table, and\\nthe placing of the Maillard bonbons in openwork silver baskets between\\nthe candelabra.  On the piano stood a large basket of orchids which Mr.\\nvan der Luyden had had sent from Skuytercliff.  Everything was, in\\nshort, as it should be on the approach of so considerable an event.\\n\\nMrs. Archer ran thoughtfully over the list, checking off each name with\\nher sharp gold pen.\\n\\n\"Henry van der Luyden--Louisa--the Lovell Mingotts--the Reggie\\nChiverses--Lawrence Lefferts and Gertrude--(yes, I suppose May was\\nright to have them)--the Selfridge Merrys, Sillerton Jackson, Van\\nNewland and his wife. (How time passes!  It seems only yesterday that\\nhe was your best man, Newland)--and Countess Olenska--yes, I think\\nthat\\'s all....\"\\n\\nMrs. Welland surveyed her son-in-law affectionately.  \"No one can say,\\nNewland, that you and May are not giving Ellen a handsome send-off.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, well,\" said Mrs. Archer, \"I understand May\\'s wanting her cousin to\\ntell people abroad that we\\'re not quite barbarians.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure Ellen will appreciate it.  She was to arrive this morning, I\\nbelieve.  It will make a most charming last impression.  The evening\\nbefore sailing is usually so dreary,\" Mrs. Welland cheerfully continued.\\n\\nArcher turned toward the door, and his mother-in-law called to him:\\n\"Do go in and have a peep at the table.  And don\\'t let May tire herself\\ntoo much.\"  But he affected not to hear, and sprang up the stairs to\\nhis library.  The room looked at him like an alien countenance composed\\ninto a polite grimace; and he perceived that it had been ruthlessly\\n\"tidied,\" and prepared, by a judicious distribution of ash-trays and\\ncedar-wood boxes, for the gentlemen to smoke in.\\n\\n\"Ah, well,\" he thought, \"it\\'s not for long--\" and he went on to his\\ndressing-room.\\n\\nTen days had passed since Madame Olenska\\'s departure from New York.\\nDuring those ten days Archer had had no sign from her but that conveyed\\nby the return of a key wrapped in tissue paper, and sent to his office\\nin a sealed envelope addressed in her hand.  This retort to his last\\nappeal might have been interpreted as a classic move in a familiar\\ngame; but the young man chose to give it a different meaning.  She was\\nstill fighting against her fate; but she was going to Europe, and she\\nwas not returning to her husband.  Nothing, therefore, was to prevent\\nhis following her; and once he had taken the irrevocable step, and had\\nproved to her that it was irrevocable, he believed she would not send\\nhim away.\\n\\nThis confidence in the future had steadied him to play his part in the\\npresent.  It had kept him from writing to her, or betraying, by any\\nsign or act, his misery and mortification.  It seemed to him that in\\nthe deadly silent game between them the trumps were still in his hands;\\nand he waited.\\n\\nThere had been, nevertheless, moments sufficiently difficult to pass;\\nas when Mr. Letterblair, the day after Madame Olenska\\'s departure, had\\nsent for him to go over the details of the trust which Mrs. Manson\\nMingott wished to create for her granddaughter.  For a couple of hours\\nArcher had examined the terms of the deed with his senior, all the\\nwhile obscurely feeling that if he had been consulted it was for some\\nreason other than the obvious one of his cousinship; and that the close\\nof the conference would reveal it.\\n\\n\"Well, the lady can\\'t deny that it\\'s a handsome arrangement,\" Mr.\\nLetterblair had summed up, after mumbling over a summary of the\\nsettlement.  \"In fact I\\'m bound to say she\\'s been treated pretty\\nhandsomely all round.\"\\n\\n\"All round?\" Archer echoed with a touch of derision.  \"Do you refer to\\nher husband\\'s proposal to give her back her own money?\"\\n\\nMr. Letterblair\\'s bushy eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch.  \"My\\ndear sir, the law\\'s the law; and your wife\\'s cousin was married under\\nthe French law.  It\\'s to be presumed she knew what that meant.\"\\n\\n\"Even if she did, what happened subsequently--.\"  But Archer paused.\\nMr. Letterblair had laid his pen-handle against his big corrugated\\nnose, and was looking down it with the expression assumed by virtuous\\nelderly gentlemen when they wish their youngers to understand that\\nvirtue is not synonymous with ignorance.\\n\\n\"My dear sir, I\\'ve no wish to extenuate the Count\\'s transgressions;\\nbut--but on the other side ... I wouldn\\'t put my hand in the fire ...\\nwell, that there hadn\\'t been tit for tat ... with the young\\nchampion....\"  Mr. Letterblair unlocked a drawer and pushed a folded\\npaper toward Archer.  \"This report, the result of discreet enquiries\\n...\"  And then, as Archer made no effort to glance at the paper or to\\nrepudiate the suggestion, the lawyer somewhat flatly continued:  \"I\\ndon\\'t say it\\'s conclusive, you observe; far from it.  But straws show\\n... and on the whole it\\'s eminently satisfactory for all parties that\\nthis dignified solution has been reached.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, eminently,\" Archer assented, pushing back the paper.\\n\\nA day or two later, on responding to a summons from Mrs. Manson\\nMingott, his soul had been more deeply tried.\\n\\nHe had found the old lady depressed and querulous.\\n\\n\"You know she\\'s deserted me?\" she began at once; and without waiting\\nfor his reply:  \"Oh, don\\'t ask me why!  She gave so many reasons that\\nI\\'ve forgotten them all.  My private belief is that she couldn\\'t face\\nthe boredom.  At any rate that\\'s what Augusta and my daughters-in-law\\nthink.  And I don\\'t know that I altogether blame her.  Olenski\\'s a\\nfinished scoundrel; but life with him must have been a good deal gayer\\nthan it is in Fifth Avenue.  Not that the family would admit that: they\\nthink Fifth Avenue is Heaven with the rue de la Paix thrown in.  And\\npoor Ellen, of course, has no idea of going back to her husband.  She\\nheld out as firmly as ever against that.  So she\\'s to settle down in\\nParis with that fool Medora....  Well, Paris is Paris; and you can keep\\na carriage there on next to nothing.  But she was as gay as a bird, and\\nI shall miss her.\" Two tears, the parched tears of the old, rolled down\\nher puffy cheeks and vanished in the abysses of her bosom.\\n\\n\"All I ask is,\" she concluded, \"that they shouldn\\'t bother me any more.\\nI must really be allowed to digest my gruel....\"  And she twinkled a\\nlittle wistfully at Archer.\\n\\nIt was that evening, on his return home, that May announced her\\nintention of giving a farewell dinner to her cousin.  Madame Olenska\\'s\\nname had not been pronounced between them since the night of her flight\\nto Washington; and Archer looked at his wife with surprise.\\n\\n\"A dinner--why?\" he interrogated.\\n\\nHer colour rose.  \"But you like Ellen--I thought you\\'d be pleased.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s awfully nice--your putting it in that way.  But I really don\\'t\\nsee--\"\\n\\n\"I mean to do it, Newland,\" she said, quietly rising and going to her\\ndesk.  \"Here are the invitations all written.  Mother helped me--she\\nagrees that we ought to.\"  She paused, embarrassed and yet smiling, and\\nArcher suddenly saw before him the embodied image of the Family.\\n\\n\"Oh, all right,\" he said, staring with unseeing eyes at the list of\\nguests that she had put in his hand.\\n\\nWhen he entered the drawing-room before dinner May was stooping over\\nthe fire and trying to coax the logs to burn in their unaccustomed\\nsetting of immaculate tiles.\\n\\nThe tall lamps were all lit, and Mr. van der Luyden\\'s orchids had been\\nconspicuously disposed in various receptacles of modern porcelain and\\nknobby silver.  Mrs. Newland Archer\\'s drawing-room was generally\\nthought a great success.  A gilt bamboo jardiniere, in which the\\nprimulas and cinerarias were punctually renewed, blocked the access to\\nthe bay window (where the old-fashioned would have preferred a bronze\\nreduction of the Venus of Milo); the sofas and arm-chairs of pale\\nbrocade were cleverly grouped about little plush tables densely covered\\nwith silver toys, porcelain animals and efflorescent photograph frames;\\nand tall rosy-shaded lamps shot up like tropical flowers among the\\npalms.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think Ellen has ever seen this room lighted up,\" said May,\\nrising flushed from her struggle, and sending about her a glance of\\npardonable pride.  The brass tongs which she had propped against the\\nside of the chimney fell with a crash that drowned her husband\\'s\\nanswer; and before he could restore them Mr. and Mrs. van der Luyden\\nwere announced.\\n\\nThe other guests quickly followed, for it was known that the van der\\nLuydens liked to dine punctually.  The room was nearly full, and Archer\\nwas engaged in showing to Mrs. Selfridge Merry a small highly-varnished\\nVerbeckhoven \"Study of Sheep,\" which Mr. Welland had given May for\\nChristmas, when he found Madame Olenska at his side.\\n\\nShe was excessively pale, and her pallor made her dark hair seem denser\\nand heavier than ever.  Perhaps that, or the fact that she had wound\\nseveral rows of amber beads about her neck, reminded him suddenly of\\nthe little Ellen Mingott he had danced with at children\\'s parties, when\\nMedora Manson had first brought her to New York.\\n\\nThe amber beads were trying to her complexion, or her dress was perhaps\\nunbecoming: her face looked lustreless and almost ugly, and he had\\nnever loved it as he did at that minute.  Their hands met, and he\\nthought he heard her say:  \"Yes, we\\'re sailing tomorrow in the\\nRussia--\"; then there was an unmeaning noise of opening doors, and\\nafter an interval May\\'s voice:  \"Newland!  Dinner\\'s been announced.\\nWon\\'t you please take Ellen in?\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska put her hand on his arm, and he noticed that the hand\\nwas ungloved, and remembered how he had kept his eyes fixed on it the\\nevening that he had sat with her in the little Twenty-third Street\\ndrawing-room.  All the beauty that had forsaken her face seemed to have\\ntaken refuge in the long pale fingers and faintly dimpled knuckles on\\nhis sleeve, and he said to himself: \"If it were only to see her hand\\nagain I  should  have  to follow her--.\"\\n\\nIt was only at an entertainment ostensibly offered to a \"foreign\\nvisitor\" that Mrs. van der Luyden could suffer the diminution of being\\nplaced on her host\\'s left.  The fact of Madame Olenska\\'s \"foreignness\"\\ncould hardly have been more adroitly emphasised than by this farewell\\ntribute; and Mrs. van der Luyden accepted her displacement with an\\naffability which left no doubt as to her approval.  There were certain\\nthings that had to be done, and if done at all, done handsomely and\\nthoroughly; and one of these, in the old New York code, was the tribal\\nrally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe.  There\\nwas nothing on earth that the Wellands and Mingotts would not have done\\nto proclaim their unalterable affection for the Countess Olenska now\\nthat her passage for Europe was engaged; and Archer, at the head of his\\ntable, sat marvelling at the silent untiring activity with which her\\npopularity had been retrieved, grievances against her silenced, her\\npast countenanced, and her present irradiated by the family approval.\\nMrs. van der Luyden shone on her with the dim benevolence which was her\\nnearest approach to cordiality, and Mr. van der Luyden, from his seat\\nat May\\'s right, cast down the table glances plainly intended to justify\\nall the carnations he had sent from Skuytercliff.\\n\\nArcher, who seemed to be assisting at the scene in a state of odd\\nimponderability, as if he floated somewhere between chandelier and\\nceiling, wondered at nothing so much as his own share in the\\nproceedings.  As his glance travelled from one placid well-fed face to\\nanother he saw all the harmless-looking people engaged upon May\\'s\\ncanvas-backs as a band of dumb conspirators, and himself and the pale\\nwoman on his right as the centre of their conspiracy.  And then it came\\nover him, in a vast flash made up of many broken gleams, that to all of\\nthem he and Madame Olenska were lovers, lovers in the extreme sense\\npeculiar to \"foreign\" vocabularies.  He guessed himself to have been,\\nfor months, the centre of countless silently observing eyes and\\npatiently listening ears; he understood that, by means as yet unknown\\nto him, the separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had\\nbeen achieved, and that now the whole tribe had rallied about his wife\\non the tacit assumption that nobody knew anything, or had ever imagined\\nanything, and that the occasion of the entertainment was simply May\\nArcher\\'s natural desire to take an affectionate leave of her friend and\\ncousin.\\n\\nIt was the old New York way of taking life \"without effusion of blood\":\\nthe way of people who dreaded scandal more than disease, who placed\\ndecency above courage, and who considered that nothing was more\\nill-bred than \"scenes,\" except the behaviour of those who gave rise to\\nthem.\\n\\nAs these thoughts succeeded each other in his mind Archer felt like a\\nprisoner in the centre of an armed camp.  He looked about the table,\\nand guessed at the inexorableness of his captors from the tone in\\nwhich, over the asparagus from Florida, they were dealing with Beaufort\\nand his wife.  \"It\\'s to show me,\" he thought, \"what would happen to\\nME--\" and a deathly sense of the superiority of implication and analogy\\nover direct action, and of silence over rash words, closed in on him\\nlike the doors of the family vault.\\n\\nHe laughed, and met Mrs. van der Luyden\\'s startled eyes.\\n\\n\"You think it laughable?\" she said with a pinched smile.  \"Of course\\npoor Regina\\'s idea of remaining in New York has its ridiculous side, I\\nsuppose;\" and Archer muttered:  \"Of course.\"\\n\\nAt this point, he became conscious that Madame Olenska\\'s other\\nneighbour had been engaged for some time with the lady on his right.\\nAt the same moment he saw that May, serenely enthroned between Mr. van\\nder Luyden and Mr. Selfridge Merry, had cast a quick glance down the\\ntable.  It was evident that the host and the lady on his right could\\nnot sit through the whole meal in silence.  He turned to Madame\\nOlenska, and her pale smile met him.  \"Oh, do let\\'s see it through,\" it\\nseemed to say.\\n\\n\"Did you find the journey tiring?\" he asked in a voice that surprised\\nhim by its naturalness; and she answered that, on the contrary, she had\\nseldom travelled with fewer discomforts.\\n\\n\"Except, you know, the dreadful heat in the train,\" she added; and he\\nremarked that she would not suffer from that particular hardship in the\\ncountry she was going to.\\n\\n\"I never,\" he declared with intensity, \"was more nearly frozen than\\nonce, in April, in the train between Calais and Paris.\"\\n\\nShe said she did not wonder, but remarked that, after all, one could\\nalways carry an extra rug, and that every form of travel had its\\nhardships; to which he abruptly returned that he thought them all of no\\naccount compared with the blessedness of getting away.  She changed\\ncolour, and he added, his voice suddenly rising in pitch:  \"I mean to\\ndo a lot of travelling myself before long.\"  A tremor crossed her face,\\nand leaning over to Reggie Chivers, he cried out:  \"I say, Reggie, what\\ndo you say to a trip round the world: now, next month, I mean?  I\\'m\\ngame if you are--\" at which Mrs. Reggie piped up that she could not\\nthink of letting Reggie go till after the Martha Washington Ball she\\nwas getting up for the Blind Asylum in Easter week; and her husband\\nplacidly observed that by that time he would have to be practising for\\nthe International Polo match.\\n\\nBut Mr. Selfridge Merry had caught the phrase \"round the world,\" and\\nhaving once circled the globe in his steam-yacht, he seized the\\nopportunity to send down the table several striking items concerning\\nthe shallowness of the Mediterranean ports.  Though, after all, he\\nadded, it didn\\'t matter; for when you\\'d seen Athens and Smyrna and\\nConstantinople, what else was there?  And Mrs. Merry said she could\\nnever be too grateful to Dr. Bencomb for having made them promise not\\nto go to Naples on account of the fever.\\n\\n\"But you must have three weeks to do India properly,\" her husband\\nconceded, anxious to have it understood that he was no frivolous\\nglobe-trotter.\\n\\nAnd at this point the ladies went up to the drawing-room.\\n\\nIn the library, in spite of weightier presences, Lawrence Lefferts\\npredominated.\\n\\nThe talk, as usual, had veered around to the Beauforts, and even Mr.\\nvan der Luyden and Mr. Selfridge Merry, installed in the honorary\\narm-chairs tacitly reserved for them, paused to listen to the younger\\nman\\'s philippic.\\n\\nNever had Lefferts so abounded in the sentiments that adorn Christian\\nmanhood and exalt the sanctity of the home.  Indignation lent him a\\nscathing eloquence, and it was clear that if others had followed his\\nexample, and acted as he talked, society would never have been weak\\nenough to receive a foreign upstart like Beaufort--no, sir, not even if\\nhe\\'d married a van der Luyden or a Lanning instead of a Dallas.  And\\nwhat chance would there have been, Lefferts wrathfully questioned, of\\nhis marrying into such a family as the Dallases, if he had not already\\nwormed his way into certain houses, as people like Mrs. Lemuel\\nStruthers had managed to worm theirs in his wake?  If society chose to\\nopen its doors to vulgar women the harm was not great, though the gain\\nwas doubtful; but once it got in the way of tolerating men of obscure\\norigin and tainted wealth the end was total disintegration--and at no\\ndistant date.\\n\\n\"If things go on at this pace,\" Lefferts thundered, looking like a\\nyoung prophet dressed by Poole, and who had not yet been stoned, \"we\\nshall see our children fighting for invitations to swindlers\\' houses,\\nand marrying Beaufort\\'s bastards.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I say--draw it mild!\" Reggie Chivers and young Newland protested,\\nwhile Mr. Selfridge Merry looked genuinely alarmed, and an expression\\nof pain and disgust settled on Mr. van der Luyden\\'s sensitive face.\\n\\n\"Has he got any?\" cried Mr. Sillerton Jackson, pricking up his ears;\\nand while Lefferts tried to turn the question with a laugh, the old\\ngentleman twittered into Archer\\'s ear:  \"Queer, those fellows who are\\nalways wanting to set things right.  The people who have the worst\\ncooks are always telling you they\\'re poisoned when they dine out.  But\\nI hear there are pressing reasons for our friend Lawrence\\'s\\ndiatribe:--typewriter this time, I understand....\"\\n\\nThe talk swept past Archer like some senseless river running and\\nrunning because it did not know enough to stop.  He saw, on the faces\\nabout him, expressions of interest, amusement and even mirth.  He\\nlistened to the younger men\\'s laughter, and to the praise of the Archer\\nMadeira, which Mr. van der Luyden and Mr. Merry were thoughtfully\\ncelebrating.  Through it all he was dimly aware of a general attitude\\nof friendliness toward himself, as if the guard of the prisoner he felt\\nhimself to be were trying to soften his captivity; and the perception\\nincreased his passionate determination to be free.\\n\\nIn the drawing-room, where they presently joined the ladies, he met\\nMay\\'s triumphant eyes, and read in them the conviction that everything\\nhad \"gone off\" beautifully.  She rose from Madame Olenska\\'s side, and\\nimmediately Mrs. van der Luyden beckoned the latter to a seat on the\\ngilt sofa where she throned.  Mrs. Selfridge Merry bore across the room\\nto join them, and it became clear to Archer that here also a conspiracy\\nof rehabilitation and obliteration was going on.  The silent\\norganisation which held his little world together was determined to put\\nitself on record as never for a moment having questioned the propriety\\nof Madame Olenska\\'s conduct, or the completeness of Archer\\'s domestic\\nfelicity.  All these amiable and inexorable persons were resolutely\\nengaged in pretending to each other that they had never heard of,\\nsuspected, or even conceived possible, the least hint to the contrary;\\nand from this tissue of elaborate mutual dissimulation Archer once more\\ndisengaged the fact that New York believed him to be Madame Olenska\\'s\\nlover.  He caught the glitter of victory in his wife\\'s eyes, and for\\nthe first time understood that she shared the belief.  The discovery\\nroused a laughter of inner devils that reverberated through all his\\nefforts to discuss the Martha Washington ball with Mrs. Reggie Chivers\\nand little Mrs. Newland; and so the evening swept on, running and\\nrunning like a senseless river that did not know how to stop.\\n\\nAt length he saw that Madame Olenska had risen and was saying good-bye.\\nHe understood that in a moment she would be gone, and tried to remember\\nwhat he had said to her at dinner; but he could not recall a single\\nword they had exchanged.\\n\\nShe went up to May, the rest of the company making a circle about her\\nas she advanced.  The two young women clasped hands; then May bent\\nforward and kissed her cousin.\\n\\n\"Certainly our hostess is much the handsomer of the two,\" Archer heard\\nReggie Chivers say in an undertone to young Mrs. Newland; and he\\nremembered Beaufort\\'s coarse sneer at May\\'s ineffectual beauty.\\n\\nA moment later he was in the hall, putting Madame Olenska\\'s cloak about\\nher shoulders.\\n\\nThrough all his confusion of mind he had held fast to the resolve to\\nsay nothing that might startle or disturb her.  Convinced that no power\\ncould now turn him from his purpose he had found strength to let events\\nshape themselves as they would.  But as he followed Madame Olenska into\\nthe hall he thought with a sudden hunger of being for a moment alone\\nwith her at the door of her carriage.\\n\\n\"Is your carriage here?\" he asked; and at that moment Mrs. van der\\nLuyden, who was being majestically inserted into her sables, said\\ngently:  \"We are driving dear Ellen home.\"\\n\\nArcher\\'s heart gave a jerk, and Madame Olenska, clasping her cloak and\\nfan with one hand, held out the other to him.  \"Good-bye,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Good-bye--but I shall see you soon in Paris,\" he answered aloud--it\\nseemed to him that he had shouted it.\\n\\n\"Oh,\" she murmured, \"if you and May could come--!\"\\n\\nMr. van der Luyden advanced to give her his arm, and Archer turned to\\nMrs. van der Luyden.  For a moment, in the billowy darkness inside the\\nbig landau, he caught the dim oval of a face, eyes shining\\nsteadily--and she was gone.\\n\\nAs he went up the steps he crossed Lawrence Lefferts coming down with\\nhis wife.  Lefferts caught his host by the sleeve, drawing back to let\\nGertrude pass.\\n\\n\"I say, old chap: do you mind just letting it be understood that I\\'m\\ndining with you at the club tomorrow night?  Thanks so much, you old\\nbrick!  Good-night.\"\\n\\n\"It DID go off beautifully, didn\\'t it?\" May questioned from the\\nthreshold of the library.\\n\\nArcher roused himself with a start.  As soon as the last carriage had\\ndriven away, he had come up to the library and shut himself in, with\\nthe hope that his wife, who still lingered below, would go straight to\\nher room.  But there she stood, pale and drawn, yet radiating the\\nfactitious energy of one who has passed beyond fatigue.\\n\\n\"May I come and talk it over?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Of course, if you like.  But you must be awfully sleepy--\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m not sleepy.  I should like to sit with you a little.\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" he said, pushing her chair near the fire.\\n\\nShe sat down and he resumed his seat; but neither spoke for a long\\ntime.  At length Archer began abruptly: \"Since you\\'re not tired, and\\nwant to talk, there\\'s something I must tell you.  I tried to the other\\nnight--.\"\\n\\nShe looked at him quickly.  \"Yes, dear.  Something about yourself?\"\\n\\n\"About myself.  You say you\\'re not tired: well, I am.  Horribly tired\\n...\"\\n\\nIn an instant she was all tender anxiety.  \"Oh, I\\'ve seen it coming on,\\nNewland!  You\\'ve been so wickedly overworked--\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it\\'s that.  Anyhow, I want to make a break--\"\\n\\n\"A break?  To give up the law?\"\\n\\n\"To go away, at any rate--at once.  On a long trip, ever so far\\noff--away from everything--\"\\n\\nHe paused, conscious that he had failed in his attempt to speak with\\nthe indifference of a man who longs for a change, and is yet too weary\\nto welcome it.  Do what he would, the chord of eagerness vibrated.\\n\"Away from everything--\" he repeated.\\n\\n\"Ever so far?  Where, for instance?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know.  India--or Japan.\"\\n\\nShe stood up, and as he sat with bent head, his chin propped on his\\nhands, he felt her warmly and fragrantly hovering over him.\\n\\n\"As far as that?  But I\\'m afraid you can\\'t, dear ...\" she said in an\\nunsteady voice.  \"Not unless you\\'ll take me with you.\"  And then, as he\\nwas silent, she went on, in tones so clear and evenly-pitched that each\\nseparate syllable tapped like a little hammer on his brain:  \"That is,\\nif the doctors will let me go ... but I\\'m afraid they won\\'t.  For you\\nsee, Newland, I\\'ve been sure since this morning of something I\\'ve been\\nso longing and hoping for--\"\\n\\nHe looked up at her with a sick stare, and she sank down, all dew and\\nroses, and hid her face against his knee.\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear,\" he said, holding her to him while his cold hand stroked\\nher hair.\\n\\nThere was a long pause, which the inner devils filled with strident\\nlaughter; then May freed herself from his arms and stood up.\\n\\n\"You didn\\'t guess--?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--I; no.  That is, of course I hoped--\"\\n\\nThey looked at each other for an instant and again fell silent; then,\\nturning his eyes from hers, he asked abruptly:  \"Have you told any one\\nelse?\"\\n\\n\"Only Mamma and your mother.\"  She paused, and then added hurriedly,\\nthe blood flushing up to her forehead:  \"That is--and Ellen.  You know\\nI told you we\\'d had a long talk one afternoon--and how dear she was to\\nme.\"\\n\\n\"Ah--\" said Archer, his heart stopping.\\n\\nHe felt that his wife was watching him intently.  \"Did you MIND my\\ntelling her first, Newland?\"\\n\\n\"Mind?  Why should I?\"  He made a last effort to collect himself.  \"But\\nthat was a fortnight ago, wasn\\'t it?  I thought you said you weren\\'t\\nsure till today.\"\\n\\nHer colour burned deeper, but she held his gaze.  \"No; I wasn\\'t sure\\nthen--but I told her I was.  And you see I was right!\" she exclaimed,\\nher blue eyes wet with victory.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nIt was generally agreed in New York that the Countess Olenska had \"lost\\nher looks.\"\\n\\nShe had appeared there first, in Newland Archer\\'s boyhood, as a\\nbrilliantly pretty little girl of nine or ten, of whom people said that\\nshe \"ought to be painted.\" Her parents had been continental wanderers,\\nand after a roaming babyhood she had lost them both, and been taken in\\ncharge by her aunt, Medora Manson, also a wanderer, who was herself\\nreturning to New York to \"settle down.\"\\n\\nPoor Medora, repeatedly widowed, was always coming home to settle down\\n(each time in a less expensive house), and bringing with her a new\\nhusband or an adopted child; but after a few months she invariably\\nparted from her husband or quarrelled with her ward, and, having got\\nrid of her house at a loss, set out again on her wanderings.  As her\\nmother had been a Rushworth, and her last unhappy marriage had linked\\nher to one of the crazy Chiverses, New York looked indulgently on her\\neccentricities; but when she returned with her little orphaned niece,\\nwhose parents had been popular in spite of their regrettable taste for\\ntravel, people thought it a pity that the pretty child should be in\\nsuch hands.\\n\\nEvery one was disposed to be kind to little Ellen Mingott, though her\\ndusky red cheeks and tight curls gave her an air of gaiety that seemed\\nunsuitable in a child who should still have been in black for her\\nparents.  It was one of the misguided Medora\\'s many peculiarities to\\nflout the unalterable rules that regulated American mourning, and when\\nshe stepped from the steamer her family were scandalised to see that\\nthe crape veil she wore for her own brother was seven inches shorter\\nthan those of her sisters-in-law, while little Ellen was in crimson\\nmerino and amber beads, like a gipsy foundling.\\n\\nBut New York had so long resigned itself to Medora that only a few old\\nladies shook their heads over Ellen\\'s gaudy clothes, while her other\\nrelations fell under the charm of her high colour and high spirits.\\nShe was a fearless and familiar little thing, who asked disconcerting\\nquestions, made precocious comments, and possessed outlandish arts,\\nsuch as dancing a Spanish shawl dance and singing Neapolitan love-songs\\nto a guitar.  Under the direction of her aunt (whose real name was Mrs.\\nThorley Chivers, but who, having received a Papal title, had resumed\\nher first husband\\'s patronymic, and called herself the Marchioness\\nManson, because in Italy she could turn it into Manzoni) the little\\ngirl received an expensive but incoherent education, which included\\n\"drawing from the model,\" a thing never dreamed of before, and playing\\nthe piano in quintets with professional musicians.\\n\\nOf course no good could come of this; and when, a few years later, poor\\nChivers finally died in a madhouse, his widow (draped in strange weeds)\\nagain pulled up stakes and departed with Ellen, who had grown into a\\ntall bony girl with conspicuous eyes.  For some time no more was heard\\nof them; then news came of Ellen\\'s marriage to an immensely rich Polish\\nnobleman of legendary fame, whom she had met at a ball at the\\nTuileries, and who was said to have princely establishments in Paris,\\nNice and Florence, a yacht at Cowes, and many square miles of shooting\\nin Transylvania.  She disappeared in a kind of sulphurous apotheosis,\\nand when a few years later Medora again came back to New York, subdued,\\nimpoverished, mourning a third husband, and in quest of a still smaller\\nhouse, people wondered that her rich niece had not been able to do\\nsomething for her.  Then came the news that Ellen\\'s own marriage had\\nended in disaster, and that she was herself returning home to seek rest\\nand oblivion among her kinsfolk.\\n\\nThese things passed through Newland Archer\\'s mind a week later as he\\nwatched the Countess Olenska enter the van der Luyden drawing-room on\\nthe evening of the momentous dinner.  The occasion was a solemn one,\\nand he wondered a little nervously how she would carry it off.  She\\ncame rather late, one hand still ungloved, and fastening a bracelet\\nabout her wrist; yet she entered without any appearance of haste or\\nembarrassment the drawing-room in which New York\\'s most chosen company\\nwas somewhat awfully assembled.\\n\\nIn the middle of the room she paused, looking about her with a grave\\nmouth and smiling eyes; and in that instant Newland Archer rejected the\\ngeneral verdict on her looks.  It was true that her early radiance was\\ngone.  The red cheeks had paled; she was thin, worn, a little\\nolder-looking than her age, which must have been nearly thirty.  But\\nthere was about her the mysterious authority of beauty, a sureness in\\nthe carriage of the head, the movement of the eyes, which, without\\nbeing in the least theatrical, struck his as highly trained and full of\\na conscious power.  At the same time she was simpler in manner than\\nmost of the ladies present, and many people (as he heard afterward from\\nJaney) were disappointed that her appearance was not more\\n\"stylish\"--for stylishness was what New York most valued.  It was,\\nperhaps, Archer reflected, because her early vivacity had disappeared;\\nbecause she was so quiet--quiet in her movements, her voice, and the\\ntones of her low-pitched voice.  New York had expected something a good\\ndeal more reasonant in a young woman with such a history.\\n\\nThe dinner was a somewhat formidable business.  Dining with the van der\\nLuydens was at best no light matter, and dining there with a Duke who\\nwas their cousin was almost a religious solemnity.  It pleased Archer\\nto think that only an old New Yorker could perceive the shade of\\ndifference (to New York) between being merely a Duke and being the van\\nder Luydens\\' Duke.  New York took stray noblemen calmly, and even\\n(except in the Struthers set) with a certain distrustful hauteur; but\\nwhen they presented such credentials as these they were received with\\nan old-fashioned cordiality that they would have been greatly mistaken\\nin ascribing solely to their standing in Debrett.  It was for just such\\ndistinctions that the young man cherished his old New York even while\\nhe smiled at it.\\n\\nThe van der Luydens had done their best to emphasise the importance of\\nthe occasion.  The du Lac Sevres and the Trevenna George II plate were\\nout; so was the van der Luyden \"Lowestoft\" (East India Company) and the\\nDagonet Crown Derby.  Mrs. van der Luyden looked more than ever like a\\nCabanel, and Mrs. Archer, in her grandmother\\'s seed-pearls and\\nemeralds, reminded her son of an Isabey miniature.  All the ladies had\\non their handsomest jewels, but it was characteristic of the house and\\nthe occasion that these were mostly in rather heavy old-fashioned\\nsettings; and old Miss Lanning, who had been persuaded to come,\\nactually wore her mother\\'s cameos and a Spanish blonde shawl.\\n\\nThe Countess Olenska was the only young woman at the dinner; yet, as\\nArcher scanned the smooth plump elderly faces between their diamond\\nnecklaces and towering ostrich feathers, they struck him as curiously\\nimmature compared with hers.  It frightened him to think what must have\\ngone to the making of her eyes.\\n\\nThe Duke of St. Austrey, who sat at his hostess\\'s right, was naturally\\nthe chief figure of the evening.  But if the Countess Olenska was less\\nconspicuous than had been hoped, the Duke was almost invisible.  Being\\na well-bred man he had not (like another recent ducal visitor) come to\\nthe dinner in a shooting-jacket; but his evening clothes were so shabby\\nand baggy, and he wore them with such an air of their being homespun,\\nthat (with his stooping way of sitting, and the vast beard spreading\\nover his shirt-front) he hardly gave the appearance of being in dinner\\nattire.  He was short, round-shouldered, sunburnt, with a thick nose,\\nsmall eyes and a sociable smile; but he seldom spoke, and when he did\\nit was in such low tones that, despite the frequent silences of\\nexpectation about the table, his remarks were lost to all but his\\nneighbours.\\n\\nWhen the men joined the ladies after dinner the Duke went straight up\\nto the Countess Olenska, and they sat down in a corner and plunged into\\nanimated talk.  Neither seemed aware that the Duke should first have\\npaid his respects to Mrs. Lovell Mingott and Mrs. Headly Chivers, and\\nthe Countess have conversed with that amiable hypochondriac, Mr. Urban\\nDagonet of Washington Square, who, in order to have the pleasure of\\nmeeting her, had broken through his fixed rule of not dining out\\nbetween January and April.  The two chatted together for nearly twenty\\nminutes; then the Countess rose and, walking alone across the wide\\ndrawing-room, sat down at Newland Archer\\'s side.\\n\\nIt was not the custom in New York drawing-rooms for a lady to get up\\nand walk away from one gentleman in order to seek the company of\\nanother.  Etiquette required that she should wait, immovable as an\\nidol, while the men who wished to converse with her succeeded each\\nother at her side.  But the Countess was apparently unaware of having\\nbroken any rule; she sat at perfect ease in a corner of the sofa beside\\nArcher, and looked at him with the kindest eyes.\\n\\n\"I want you to talk to me about May,\" she said.\\n\\nInstead of answering her he asked:  \"You knew the Duke before?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes--we used to see him every winter at Nice.  He\\'s very fond of\\ngambling--he used to come to the house a great deal.\"  She said it in\\nthe simplest manner, as if she had said:  \"He\\'s fond of wild-flowers\";\\nand after a moment she added candidly:  \"I think he\\'s the dullest man I\\never met.\"\\n\\nThis pleased her companion so much that he forgot the slight shock her\\nprevious remark had caused him.  It was undeniably exciting to meet a\\nlady who found the van der Luydens\\' Duke dull, and dared to utter the\\nopinion.  He longed to question her, to hear more about the life of\\nwhich her careless words had given him so illuminating a glimpse; but\\nhe feared to touch on distressing memories, and before he could think\\nof anything to say she had strayed back to her original subject.\\n\\n\"May is a darling; I\\'ve seen no young girl in New York so handsome and\\nso intelligent.  Are you very much in love with her?\"\\n\\nNewland Archer reddened and laughed.  \"As much as a man can be.\"\\n\\nShe continued to consider him thoughtfully, as if not to miss any shade\\nof meaning in what he said, \"Do you think, then, there is a limit?\"\\n\\n\"To being in love?  If there is, I haven\\'t found it!\"\\n\\nShe glowed with sympathy.  \"Ah--it\\'s really and truly a romance?\"\\n\\n\"The most romantic of romances!\"\\n\\n\"How delightful!  And you found it all out for yourselves--it was not\\nin the least arranged for you?\"\\n\\nArcher looked at her incredulously.  \"Have you forgotten,\" he asked\\nwith a smile, \"that in our country we don\\'t allow our marriages to be\\narranged for us?\"\\n\\nA dusky blush rose to her cheek, and he instantly regretted his words.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered, \"I\\'d forgotten.  You must forgive me if I\\nsometimes make these mistakes.  I don\\'t always remember that everything\\nhere is good that was--that was bad where I\\'ve come from.\"  She looked\\ndown at her Viennese fan of eagle feathers, and he saw that her lips\\ntrembled.\\n\\n\"I\\'m so sorry,\" he said impulsively; \"but you ARE among friends here,\\nyou know.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--I know.  Wherever I go I have that feeling.  That\\'s why I came\\nhome.  I want to forget everything else, to become a complete American\\nagain, like the Mingotts and Wellands, and you and your delightful\\nmother, and all the other good people here tonight.  Ah, here\\'s May\\narriving, and you will want to hurry away to her,\" she added, but\\nwithout moving; and her eyes turned back from the door to rest on the\\nyoung man\\'s face.\\n\\nThe drawing-rooms were beginning to fill up with after-dinner guests,\\nand following Madame Olenska\\'s glance Archer saw May Welland entering\\nwith her mother.  In her dress of white and silver, with a wreath of\\nsilver blossoms in her hair, the tall girl looked like a Diana just\\nalight from the chase.\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Archer, \"I have so many rivals; you see she\\'s already\\nsurrounded.  There\\'s the Duke being introduced.\"\\n\\n\"Then stay with me a little longer,\" Madame Olenska said in a low tone,\\njust touching his knee with her plumed fan.  It was the lightest touch,\\nbut it thrilled him like a caress.\\n\\n\"Yes, let me stay,\" he answered in the same tone, hardly knowing what\\nhe said; but just then Mr. van der Luyden came up, followed by old Mr.\\nUrban Dagonet.  The Countess greeted them with her grave smile, and\\nArcher, feeling his host\\'s admonitory glance on him, rose and\\nsurrendered his seat.\\n\\nMadame Olenska held out her hand as if to bid him goodbye.\\n\\n\"Tomorrow, then, after five--I shall expect you,\" she said; and then\\nturned back to make room for Mr. Dagonet.\\n\\n\"Tomorrow--\" Archer heard himself repeating, though there had been no\\nengagement, and during their talk she had given him no hint that she\\nwished to see him again.\\n\\nAs he moved away he saw Lawrence Lefferts, tall and resplendent,\\nleading his wife up to be introduced; and heard Gertrude Lefferts say,\\nas she beamed on the Countess with her large unperceiving smile:  \"But\\nI think we used to go to dancing-school together when we were\\nchildren--.\"  Behind her, waiting their turn to name themselves to the\\nCountess, Archer noticed a number of the recalcitrant couples who had\\ndeclined to meet her at Mrs. Lovell Mingott\\'s.  As Mrs. Archer\\nremarked: when the van der Luydens chose, they knew how to give a\\nlesson.  The wonder was that they chose so seldom.\\n\\nThe young man felt a touch on his arm and saw Mrs. van der Luyden\\nlooking down on him from the pure eminence of black velvet and the\\nfamily diamonds.  \"It was good of you, dear Newland, to devote yourself\\nso unselfishly to Madame Olenska.  I told your cousin Henry he must\\nreally come to the rescue.\"\\n\\nHe was aware of smiling at her vaguely, and she added, as if\\ncondescending to his natural shyness:  \"I\\'ve never seen May looking\\nlovelier.  The Duke thinks her the handsomest girl in the room.\"\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\n\"Of course we must dine with Mrs. Carfry, dearest,\" Archer said; and\\nhis wife looked at him with an anxious frown across the monumental\\nBritannia ware of their lodging house breakfast-table.\\n\\nIn all the rainy desert of autumnal London there were only two people\\nwhom the Newland Archers knew; and these two they had sedulously\\navoided, in conformity with the old New York tradition that it was not\\n\"dignified\" to force one\\'s self on the notice of one\\'s acquaintances in\\nforeign countries.\\n\\nMrs. Archer and Janey, in the course of their visits to Europe, had so\\nunflinchingly lived up to this principle, and met the friendly advances\\nof their fellow-travellers with an air of such impenetrable reserve,\\nthat they had almost achieved the record of never having exchanged a\\nword with a \"foreigner\" other than those employed in hotels and\\nrailway-stations.  Their own compatriots--save those previously known\\nor properly accredited--they treated with an even more pronounced\\ndisdain; so that, unless they ran across a Chivers, a Dagonet or a\\nMingott, their months abroad were spent in an unbroken tete-a-tete.\\nBut the utmost precautions are sometimes unavailing; and one night at\\nBotzen one of the two English ladies in the room across the passage\\n(whose names, dress and social situation were already intimately known\\nto Janey) had knocked on the door and asked if Mrs. Archer had a bottle\\nof liniment.  The other lady--the intruder\\'s sister, Mrs. Carfry--had\\nbeen seized with a sudden attack of bronchitis; and Mrs. Archer, who\\nnever travelled without a complete family pharmacy, was fortunately\\nable to produce the required remedy.\\n\\nMrs. Carfry was very ill, and as she and her sister Miss Harle were\\ntravelling alone they were profoundly grateful to the Archer ladies,\\nwho supplied them with ingenious comforts and whose efficient maid\\nhelped to nurse the invalid back to health.\\n\\nWhen the Archers left Botzen they had no idea of ever seeing Mrs.\\nCarfry and Miss Harle again.  Nothing, to Mrs. Archer\\'s mind, would\\nhave been more \"undignified\" than to force one\\'s self on the notice of\\na \"foreigner\" to whom one had happened to render an accidental service.\\nBut Mrs. Carfry and her sister, to whom this point of view was unknown,\\nand who would have found it utterly incomprehensible, felt themselves\\nlinked by an eternal gratitude to the \"delightful Americans\" who had\\nbeen so kind at Botzen.  With touching fidelity they seized every\\nchance of meeting Mrs. Archer and Janey in the course of their\\ncontinental travels, and displayed a supernatural acuteness in finding\\nout when they were to pass through London on their way to or from the\\nStates.  The intimacy became indissoluble, and Mrs. Archer and Janey,\\nwhenever they alighted at Brown\\'s Hotel, found themselves awaited by\\ntwo affectionate friends who, like themselves, cultivated ferns in\\nWardian cases, made macrame lace, read the memoirs of the Baroness\\nBunsen and had views about the occupants of the leading London pulpits.\\nAs Mrs. Archer said, it made \"another thing of London\" to know Mrs.\\nCarfry and Miss Harle; and by the time that Newland became engaged the\\ntie between the families was so firmly established that it was thought\\n\"only right\" to send a wedding invitation to the two English ladies,\\nwho sent, in return, a pretty bouquet of pressed Alpine flowers under\\nglass.  And on the dock, when Newland and his wife sailed for England,\\nMrs. Archer\\'s last word had been:  \"You must take May to see Mrs.\\nCarfry.\"\\n\\nNewland and his wife had had no idea of obeying this injunction; but\\nMrs. Carfry, with her usual acuteness, had run them down and sent them\\nan invitation to dine; and it was over this invitation that May Archer\\nwas wrinkling her brows across the tea and muffins.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all very well for you, Newland; you KNOW them.  But I shall feel\\nso shy among a lot of people I\\'ve never met.  And what shall I wear?\"\\n\\nNewland leaned back in his chair and smiled at her.  She looked\\nhandsomer and more Diana-like than ever.  The moist English air seemed\\nto have deepened the bloom of her cheeks and softened the slight\\nhardness of her virginal features; or else it was simply the inner glow\\nof happiness, shining through like a light under ice.\\n\\n\"Wear, dearest?  I thought a trunkful of things had come from Paris\\nlast week.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, of course.  I meant to say that I shan\\'t know WHICH to wear.\"\\nShe pouted a little.  \"I\\'ve never dined out in London; and I don\\'t want\\nto be ridiculous.\"\\n\\nHe tried to enter into her perplexity.  \"But don\\'t Englishwomen dress\\njust like everybody else in the evening?\"\\n\\n\"Newland!  How can you ask such funny questions?  When they go to the\\ntheatre in old ball-dresses and bare heads.\"\\n\\n\"Well, perhaps they wear new ball-dresses at home; but at any rate Mrs.\\nCarfry and Miss Harle won\\'t.  They\\'ll wear caps like my mother\\'s--and\\nshawls; very soft shawls.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but how will the other women be dressed?\"\\n\\n\"Not as well as you, dear,\" he rejoined, wondering what had suddenly\\ndeveloped in her Janey\\'s morbid interest in clothes.\\n\\nShe pushed back her chair with a sigh.  \"That\\'s dear of you, Newland;\\nbut it doesn\\'t help me much.\"\\n\\nHe had an inspiration.  \"Why not wear your wedding-dress?  That can\\'t\\nbe wrong, can it?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dearest!  If I only had it here!  But it\\'s gone to Paris to be\\nmade over for next winter, and Worth hasn\\'t sent it back.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, well--\" said Archer, getting up.  \"Look here--the fog\\'s lifting.\\nIf we made a dash for the National Gallery we might manage to catch a\\nglimpse of the pictures.\"\\n\\n\\nThe Newland Archers were on their way home, after a three months\\'\\nwedding-tour which May, in writing to her girl friends, vaguely\\nsummarised as \"blissful.\"\\n\\nThey had not gone to the Italian Lakes: on reflection, Archer had not\\nbeen able to picture his wife in that particular setting.  Her own\\ninclination (after a month with the Paris dressmakers) was for\\nmountaineering in July and swimming in August.  This plan they\\npunctually fulfilled, spending July at Interlaken and Grindelwald, and\\nAugust at a little place called Etretat, on the Normandy coast, which\\nsome one had recommended as quaint and quiet.  Once or twice, in the\\nmountains, Archer had pointed southward and said: \"There\\'s Italy\"; and\\nMay, her feet in a gentian-bed, had smiled cheerfully, and replied:\\n\"It would be lovely to go there next winter, if only you didn\\'t have to\\nbe in New York.\"\\n\\nBut in reality travelling interested her even less than he had\\nexpected.  She regarded it (once her clothes were ordered) as merely an\\nenlarged opportunity for walking, riding, swimming, and trying her hand\\nat the fascinating new game of lawn tennis; and when they finally got\\nback to London (where they were to spend a fortnight while he ordered\\nHIS clothes) she no longer concealed the eagerness with which she\\nlooked forward to sailing.\\n\\nIn London nothing interested her but the theatres and the shops; and\\nshe found the theatres less exciting than the Paris cafes chantants\\nwhere, under the blossoming horse-chestnuts of the Champs Elysees, she\\nhad had the novel experience of looking down from the restaurant\\nterrace on an audience of \"cocottes,\" and having her husband interpret\\nto her as much of the songs as he thought suitable for bridal ears.\\n\\nArcher had reverted to all his old inherited ideas about marriage.  It\\nwas less trouble to conform with the tradition and treat May exactly as\\nall his friends treated their wives than to try to put into practice\\nthe theories with which his untrammelled bachelorhood had dallied.\\nThere was no use in trying to emancipate a wife who had not the dimmest\\nnotion that she was not free; and he had long since discovered that\\nMay\\'s only use of the liberty she supposed herself to possess would be\\nto lay it on the altar of her wifely adoration.  Her innate dignity\\nwould always keep her from making the gift abjectly; and a day might\\neven come (as it once had) when she would find strength to take it\\naltogether back if she thought she were doing it for his own good.  But\\nwith a conception of marriage so uncomplicated and incurious as hers\\nsuch a crisis could be brought about only by something visibly\\noutrageous in his own conduct; and the fineness of her feeling for him\\nmade that unthinkable.  Whatever happened, he knew, she would always be\\nloyal, gallant and unresentful; and that pledged him to the practice of\\nthe same virtues.\\n\\nAll this tended to draw him back into his old habits of mind.  If her\\nsimplicity had been the simplicity of pettiness he would have chafed\\nand rebelled; but since the lines of her character, though so few, were\\non the same fine mould as her face, she became the tutelary divinity of\\nall his old traditions and reverences.\\n\\nSuch qualities were scarcely of the kind to enliven foreign travel,\\nthough they made her so easy and pleasant a companion; but he saw at\\nonce how they would fall into place in their proper setting.  He had no\\nfear of being oppressed by them, for his artistic and intellectual life\\nwould go on, as it always had, outside the domestic circle; and within\\nit there would be nothing small and stifling--coming back to his wife\\nwould never be like entering a stuffy room after a tramp in the open.\\nAnd when they had children the vacant corners in both their lives would\\nbe filled.\\n\\nAll these things went through his mind during their long slow drive\\nfrom Mayfair to South Kensington, where Mrs. Carfry and her sister\\nlived.  Archer too would have preferred to escape their friends\\'\\nhospitality: in conformity with the family tradition he had always\\ntravelled as a sight-seer and looker-on, affecting a haughty\\nunconsciousness of the presence of his fellow-beings.  Once only, just\\nafter Harvard, he had spent a few gay weeks at Florence with a band of\\nqueer Europeanised Americans, dancing all night with titled ladies in\\npalaces, and gambling half the day with the rakes and dandies of the\\nfashionable club; but it had all seemed to him, though the greatest fun\\nin the world, as unreal as a carnival.  These queer cosmopolitan women,\\ndeep in complicated love-affairs which they appeared to feel the need\\nof retailing to every one they met, and the magnificent young officers\\nand elderly dyed wits who were the subjects or the recipients of their\\nconfidences, were too different from the people Archer had grown up\\namong, too much like expensive and rather malodorous hot-house exotics,\\nto detain his imagination long.  To introduce his wife into such a\\nsociety was out of the question; and in the course of his travels no\\nother had shown any marked eagerness for his company.\\n\\nNot long after their arrival in London he had run across the Duke of\\nSt. Austrey, and the Duke, instantly and cordially recognising him, had\\nsaid:  \"Look me up, won\\'t you?\"--but no proper-spirited American would\\nhave considered that a suggestion to be acted on, and the meeting was\\nwithout a sequel.  They had even managed to avoid May\\'s English aunt,\\nthe banker\\'s wife, who was still in Yorkshire; in fact, they had\\npurposely postponed going to London till the autumn in order that their\\narrival during the season might not appear pushing and snobbish to\\nthese unknown relatives.\\n\\n\"Probably there\\'ll be nobody at Mrs. Carfry\\'s--London\\'s a desert at\\nthis season, and you\\'ve made yourself much too beautiful,\" Archer said\\nto May, who sat at his side in the hansom so spotlessly splendid in her\\nsky-blue cloak edged with swansdown that it seemed wicked to expose her\\nto the London grime.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want them to think that we dress like savages,\" she replied,\\nwith a scorn that Pocahontas might have resented; and he was struck\\nagain by the religious reverence of even the most unworldly American\\nwomen for the social advantages of dress.\\n\\n\"It\\'s their armour,\" he thought, \"their defence against the unknown,\\nand their defiance of it.\"  And he understood for the first time the\\nearnestness with which May, who was incapable of tying a ribbon in her\\nhair to charm him, had gone through the solemn rite of selecting and\\nordering her extensive wardrobe.\\n\\nHe had been right in expecting the party at Mrs. Carfry\\'s to be a small\\none.  Besides their hostess and her sister, they found, in the long\\nchilly drawing-room, only another shawled lady, a genial Vicar who was\\nher husband, a silent lad whom Mrs. Carfry named as her nephew, and a\\nsmall dark gentleman with lively eyes whom she introduced as his tutor,\\npronouncing a French name as she did so.\\n\\nInto this dimly-lit and dim-featured group May Archer floated like a\\nswan with the sunset on her: she seemed larger, fairer, more\\nvoluminously rustling than her husband had ever seen her; and he\\nperceived that the rosiness and rustlingness were the tokens of an\\nextreme and infantile shyness.\\n\\n\"What on earth will they expect me to talk about?\" her helpless eyes\\nimplored him, at the very moment that her dazzling apparition was\\ncalling forth the same anxiety in their own bosoms.  But beauty, even\\nwhen distrustful of itself, awakens confidence in the manly heart; and\\nthe Vicar and the French-named tutor were soon manifesting to May their\\ndesire to put her at her ease.\\n\\nIn spite of their best efforts, however, the dinner was a languishing\\naffair.  Archer noticed that his wife\\'s way of showing herself at her\\nease with foreigners was to become more uncompromisingly local in her\\nreferences, so that, though her loveliness was an encouragement to\\nadmiration, her conversation was a chill to repartee.  The Vicar soon\\nabandoned the struggle; but the tutor, who spoke the most fluent and\\naccomplished English, gallantly continued to pour it out to her until\\nthe ladies, to the manifest relief of all concerned, went up to the\\ndrawing-room.\\n\\nThe Vicar, after a glass of port, was obliged to hurry away to a\\nmeeting, and the shy nephew, who appeared to be an invalid, was packed\\noff to bed.  But Archer and the tutor continued to sit over their wine,\\nand suddenly Archer found himself talking as he had not done since his\\nlast symposium with Ned Winsett.  The Carfry nephew, it turned out, had\\nbeen threatened with consumption, and had had to leave Harrow for\\nSwitzerland, where he had spent two years in the milder air of Lake\\nLeman.  Being a bookish youth, he had been entrusted to M. Riviere, who\\nhad brought him back to England, and was to remain with him till he\\nwent up to Oxford the following spring; and M. Riviere added with\\nsimplicity that he should then have to look out for another job.\\n\\nIt seemed impossible, Archer thought, that he should be long without\\none, so varied were his interests and so many his gifts.  He was a man\\nof about thirty, with a thin ugly face (May would certainly have called\\nhim common-looking) to which the play of his ideas gave an intense\\nexpressiveness; but there was nothing frivolous or cheap in his\\nanimation.\\n\\nHis father, who had died young, had filled a small diplomatic post, and\\nit had been intended that the son should follow the same career; but an\\ninsatiable taste for letters had thrown the young man into journalism,\\nthen into authorship (apparently unsuccessful), and at length--after\\nother experiments and vicissitudes which he spared his listener--into\\ntutoring English youths in Switzerland.  Before that, however, he had\\nlived much in Paris, frequented the Goncourt grenier, been advised by\\nMaupassant not to attempt to write (even that seemed to Archer a\\ndazzling honour!), and had often talked with Merimee in his mother\\'s\\nhouse.  He had obviously always been desperately poor and anxious\\n(having a mother and an unmarried sister to provide for), and it was\\napparent that his literary ambitions had failed.  His situation, in\\nfact, seemed, materially speaking, no more brilliant than Ned\\nWinsett\\'s; but he had lived in a world in which, as he said, no one who\\nloved ideas need hunger mentally.  As it was precisely of that love\\nthat poor Winsett was starving to death, Archer looked with a sort of\\nvicarious envy at this eager impecunious young man who had fared so\\nrichly in his poverty.\\n\\n\"You see, Monsieur, it\\'s worth everything, isn\\'t it, to keep one\\'s\\nintellectual liberty, not to enslave one\\'s powers of appreciation,\\none\\'s critical independence?  It was because of that that I abandoned\\njournalism, and took to so much duller work: tutoring and private\\nsecretaryship.  There is a good deal of drudgery, of course; but one\\npreserves one\\'s moral freedom, what we call in French one\\'s quant a\\nsoi.  And when one hears good talk one can join in it without\\ncompromising any opinions but one\\'s own; or one can listen, and answer\\nit inwardly.  Ah, good conversation--there\\'s nothing like it, is there?\\nThe air of ideas is the only air worth breathing.  And so I have never\\nregretted giving up either diplomacy or journalism--two different forms\\nof the same self-abdication.\"  He fixed his vivid eyes on Archer as he\\nlit another cigarette.  \"Voyez-vous, Monsieur, to be able to look life\\nin the face: that\\'s worth living in a garret for, isn\\'t it?  But, after\\nall, one must earn enough to pay for the garret; and I confess that to\\ngrow old as a private tutor--or a \\'private\\' anything--is almost as\\nchilling to the imagination as a second secretaryship at Bucharest.\\nSometimes I feel I must make a plunge: an immense plunge.  Do you\\nsuppose, for instance, there would be any opening for me in America--in\\nNew York?\"\\n\\nArcher looked at him with startled eyes.  New York, for a young man who\\nhad frequented the Goncourts and Flaubert, and who thought the life of\\nideas the only one worth living!  He continued to stare at M.  Riviere\\nperplexedly, wondering how to tell him that his very superiorities and\\nadvantages would be the surest hindrance to success.\\n\\n\"New York--New York--but must it be especially New York?\" he stammered,\\nutterly unable to imagine what lucrative opening his native city could\\noffer to a young man to whom good conversation appeared to be the only\\nnecessity.\\n\\nA sudden flush rose under M. Riviere\\'s sallow skin.  \"I--I thought it\\nyour metropolis: is not the intellectual life more active there?\" he\\nrejoined; then, as if fearing to give his hearer the impression of\\nhaving asked a favour, he went on hastily:  \"One throws out random\\nsuggestions--more to one\\'s self than to others.  In reality, I see no\\nimmediate prospect--\" and rising from his seat he added, without a\\ntrace of constraint:  \"But Mrs. Carfry will think that I ought to be\\ntaking you upstairs.\"\\n\\nDuring the homeward drive Archer pondered deeply on this episode.  His\\nhour with M. Riviere had put new air into his lungs, and his first\\nimpulse had been to invite him to dine the next day; but he was\\nbeginning to understand why married men did not always immediately\\nyield to their first impulses.\\n\\n\"That young tutor is an interesting fellow: we had some awfully good\\ntalk after dinner about books and things,\" he threw out tentatively in\\nthe hansom.\\n\\nMay roused herself from one of the dreamy silences into which he had\\nread so many meanings before six months of marriage had given him the\\nkey to them.\\n\\n\"The little Frenchman?  Wasn\\'t he dreadfully common?\" she questioned\\ncoldly; and he guessed that she nursed a secret disappointment at\\nhaving been invited out in London to meet a clergyman and a French\\ntutor.  The disappointment was not occasioned by the sentiment\\nordinarily defined as snobbishness, but by old New York\\'s sense of what\\nwas due to it when it risked its dignity in foreign lands.  If May\\'s\\nparents had entertained the Carfrys in Fifth Avenue they would have\\noffered them something more substantial than a parson and a\\nschoolmaster.\\n\\nBut Archer was on edge, and took her up.\\n\\n\"Common--common WHERE?\" he queried; and she returned with unusual\\nreadiness:  \"Why, I should say anywhere but in his school-room.  Those\\npeople are always awkward in society.  But then,\" she added\\ndisarmingly, \"I suppose I shouldn\\'t have known if he was clever.\"\\n\\nArcher disliked her use of the word \"clever\" almost as much as her use\\nof the word \"common\"; but he was beginning to fear his tendency to\\ndwell on the things he disliked in her.  After all, her point of view\\nhad always been the same.  It was that of all the people he had grown\\nup among, and he had always regarded it as necessary but negligible.\\nUntil a few months ago he had never known a \"nice\" woman who looked at\\nlife differently; and if a man married it must necessarily be among the\\nnice.\\n\\n\"Ah--then I won\\'t ask him to dine!\" he concluded with a laugh; and May\\nechoed, bewildered:  \"Goodness--ask the Carfrys\\' tutor?\"\\n\\n\"Well, not on the same day with the Carfrys, if you prefer I shouldn\\'t.\\nBut I did rather want another talk with him.  He\\'s looking for a job in\\nNew York.\"\\n\\nHer surprise increased with her indifference: he almost fancied that\\nshe suspected him of being tainted with \"foreignness.\"\\n\\n\"A job in New York?  What sort of a job?  People don\\'t have French\\ntutors: what does he want to do?\"\\n\\n\"Chiefly to enjoy good conversation, I understand,\" her husband\\nretorted perversely; and she broke into an appreciative laugh.  \"Oh,\\nNewland, how funny!  Isn\\'t that FRENCH?\"\\n\\nOn the whole, he was glad to have the matter settled for him by her\\nrefusing to take seriously his wish to invite M. Riviere.  Another\\nafter-dinner talk would have made it difficult to avoid the question of\\nNew York; and the more Archer considered it the less he was able to fit\\nM. Riviere into any conceivable picture of New York as he knew it.\\n\\nHe perceived with a flash of chilling insight that in future many\\nproblems would be thus negatively solved for him; but as he paid the\\nhansom and followed his wife\\'s long train into the house he took refuge\\nin the comforting platitude that the first six months were always the\\nmost difficult in marriage.  \"After that I suppose we shall have pretty\\nnearly finished rubbing off each other\\'s angles,\" he reflected; but the\\nworst of it was that May\\'s pressure was already bearing on the very\\nangles whose sharpness he most wanted to keep.',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nThe Countess Olenska had said \"after five\"; and at half after the hour\\nNewland Archer rang the bell of the peeling stucco house with a giant\\nwisteria throttling its feeble cast-iron balcony, which she had hired,\\nfar down West Twenty-third Street, from the vagabond Medora.\\n\\nIt was certainly a strange quarter to have settled in.  Small\\ndress-makers, bird-stuffers and \"people who wrote\" were her nearest\\nneighbours; and further down the dishevelled street Archer recognised a\\ndilapidated wooden house, at the end of a paved path, in which a writer\\nand journalist called Winsett, whom he used to come across now and\\nthen, had mentioned that he lived.  Winsett did not invite people to\\nhis house; but he had once pointed it out to Archer in the course of a\\nnocturnal stroll, and the latter had asked himself, with a little\\nshiver, if the humanities were so meanly housed in other capitals.\\n\\nMadame Olenska\\'s own dwelling was redeemed from the same appearance\\nonly by a little more paint about the window-frames; and as Archer\\nmustered its modest front he said to himself that the Polish Count must\\nhave robbed her of her fortune as well as of her illusions.\\n\\nThe young man had spent an unsatisfactory day.  He had lunched with the\\nWellands, hoping afterward to carry off May for a walk in the Park.  He\\nwanted to have her to himself, to tell her how enchanting she had\\nlooked the night before, and how proud he was of her, and to press her\\nto hasten their marriage.  But Mrs. Welland had firmly reminded him\\nthat the round of family visits was not half over, and, when he hinted\\nat advancing the date of the wedding, had raised reproachful eye-brows\\nand sighed out:  \"Twelve dozen of everything--hand-embroidered--\"\\n\\nPacked in the family landau they rolled from one tribal doorstep to\\nanother, and Archer, when the afternoon\\'s round was over, parted from\\nhis betrothed with the feeling that he had been shown off like a wild\\nanimal cunningly trapped.  He supposed that his readings in\\nanthropology caused him to take such a coarse view of what was after\\nall a simple and natural demonstration of family feeling; but when he\\nremembered that the Wellands did not expect the wedding to take place\\ntill the following autumn, and pictured what his life would be till\\nthen, a dampness fell upon his spirit.\\n\\n\"Tomorrow,\" Mrs. Welland called after him, \"we\\'ll do the Chiverses and\\nthe Dallases\"; and he perceived that she was going through their two\\nfamilies alphabetically, and that they were only in the first quarter\\nof the alphabet.\\n\\nHe had meant to tell May of the Countess Olenska\\'s request--her\\ncommand, rather--that he should call on her that afternoon; but in the\\nbrief moments when they were alone he had had more pressing things to\\nsay.  Besides, it struck him as a little absurd to allude to the\\nmatter.  He knew that May most particularly wanted him to be kind to\\nher cousin; was it not that wish which had hastened the announcement of\\ntheir engagement?  It gave him an odd sensation to reflect that, but\\nfor the Countess\\'s arrival, he might have been, if not still a free\\nman, at least a man less irrevocably pledged.  But May had willed it\\nso, and he felt himself somehow relieved of further responsibility--and\\ntherefore at liberty, if he chose, to call on her cousin without\\ntelling her.\\n\\nAs he stood on Madame Olenska\\'s threshold curiosity was his uppermost\\nfeeling.  He was puzzled by the tone in which she had summoned him; he\\nconcluded that she was less simple than she seemed.\\n\\nThe door was opened by a swarthy foreign-looking maid, with a prominent\\nbosom under a gay neckerchief, whom he vaguely fancied to be Sicilian.\\nShe welcomed him with all her white teeth, and answering his enquiries\\nby a head-shake of incomprehension led him through the narrow hall into\\na low firelit drawing-room.  The room was empty, and she left him, for\\nan appreciable time, to wonder whether she had gone to find her\\nmistress, or whether she had not understood what he was there for, and\\nthought it might be to wind the clock--of which he perceived that the\\nonly visible specimen had stopped.  He knew that the southern races\\ncommunicated with each other in the language of pantomime, and was\\nmortified to find her shrugs and smiles so unintelligible.  At length\\nshe returned with a lamp; and Archer, having meanwhile put together a\\nphrase out of Dante and Petrarch, evoked the answer: \"La signora e\\nfuori; ma verra subito\"; which he took to mean:  \"She\\'s out--but you\\'ll\\nsoon see.\"\\n\\nWhat he saw, meanwhile, with the help of the lamp, was the faded\\nshadowy charm of a room unlike any room he had known.  He knew that the\\nCountess Olenska had brought some of her possessions with her--bits of\\nwreckage, she called them--and these, he supposed, were represented by\\nsome small slender tables of dark wood, a delicate little Greek bronze\\non the chimney-piece, and a stretch of red damask nailed on the\\ndiscoloured wallpaper behind a couple of Italian-looking pictures in\\nold frames.\\n\\nNewland Archer prided himself on his knowledge of Italian art.  His\\nboyhood had been saturated with Ruskin, and he had read all the latest\\nbooks: John Addington Symonds, Vernon Lee\\'s \"Euphorion,\" the essays of\\nP. G. Hamerton, and a wonderful new volume called \"The Renaissance\" by\\nWalter Pater.  He talked easily of Botticelli, and spoke of Fra\\nAngelico with a faint condescension.  But these pictures bewildered\\nhim, for they were like nothing that he was accustomed to look at (and\\ntherefore able to see) when he travelled in Italy; and perhaps, also,\\nhis powers of observation were impaired by the oddness of finding\\nhimself in this strange empty house, where apparently no one expected\\nhim.  He was sorry that he had not told May Welland of Countess\\nOlenska\\'s request, and a little disturbed by the thought that his\\nbetrothed might come in to see her cousin.  What would she think if she\\nfound him sitting there with the air of intimacy implied by waiting\\nalone in the dusk at a lady\\'s fireside?\\n\\nBut since he had come he meant to wait; and he sank into a chair and\\nstretched his feet to the logs.\\n\\nIt was odd to have summoned him in that way, and then forgotten him;\\nbut Archer felt more curious than mortified.  The atmosphere of the\\nroom was so different from any he had ever breathed that\\nself-consciousness vanished in the sense of adventure.  He had been\\nbefore in drawing-rooms hung with red damask, with pictures \"of the\\nItalian school\"; what struck him was the way in which Medora Manson\\'s\\nshabby hired house, with its blighted background of pampas grass and\\nRogers statuettes, had, by a turn of the hand, and the skilful use of a\\nfew properties, been transformed into something intimate, \"foreign,\"\\nsubtly suggestive of old romantic scenes and sentiments.  He tried to\\nanalyse the trick, to find a clue to it in the way the chairs and\\ntables were grouped, in the fact that only two Jacqueminot roses (of\\nwhich nobody ever bought less than a dozen) had been placed in the\\nslender vase at his elbow, and in the vague pervading perfume that was\\nnot what one put on handkerchiefs, but rather like the scent of some\\nfar-off bazaar, a smell made up of Turkish coffee and ambergris and\\ndried roses.\\n\\nHis mind wandered away to the question of what May\\'s drawing-room would\\nlook like.  He knew that Mr. Welland, who was behaving \"very\\nhandsomely,\" already had his eye on a newly built house in East\\nThirty-ninth Street.  The neighbourhood was thought remote, and the\\nhouse was built in a ghastly greenish-yellow stone that the younger\\narchitects were beginning to employ as a protest against the brownstone\\nof which the uniform hue coated New York like a cold chocolate sauce;\\nbut the plumbing was perfect.  Archer would have liked to travel, to\\nput off the housing question; but, though the Wellands approved of an\\nextended European honeymoon (perhaps even a winter in Egypt), they were\\nfirm as to the need of a house for the returning couple.  The young man\\nfelt that his fate was sealed: for the rest of his life he would go up\\nevery evening between the cast-iron railings of that greenish-yellow\\ndoorstep, and pass through a Pompeian vestibule into a hall with a\\nwainscoting of varnished yellow wood.  But beyond that his imagination\\ncould not travel.  He knew the drawing-room above had a bay window, but\\nhe could not fancy how May would deal with it.  She submitted\\ncheerfully to the purple satin and yellow tuftings of the Welland\\ndrawing-room, to its sham Buhl tables and gilt vitrines full of modern\\nSaxe.  He saw no reason to suppose that she would want anything\\ndifferent in her own house; and his only comfort was to reflect that\\nshe would probably let him arrange his library as he pleased--which\\nwould be, of course, with \"sincere\" Eastlake furniture, and the plain\\nnew bookcases without glass doors.\\n\\nThe round-bosomed maid came in, drew the curtains, pushed back a log,\\nand said consolingly: \"Verra--verra.\"  When she had gone Archer stood\\nup and began to wander about.  Should he wait any longer?  His position\\nwas becoming rather foolish.  Perhaps he had misunderstood Madame\\nOlenska--perhaps she had not invited him after all.\\n\\nDown the cobblestones of the quiet street came the ring of a stepper\\'s\\nhoofs; they stopped before the house, and he caught the opening of a\\ncarriage door.  Parting the curtains he looked out into the early dusk.\\nA street-lamp faced him, and in its light he saw Julius Beaufort\\'s\\ncompact English brougham, drawn by a big roan, and the banker\\ndescending from it, and helping out Madame Olenska.\\n\\nBeaufort stood, hat in hand, saying something which his companion\\nseemed to negative; then they shook hands, and he jumped into his\\ncarriage while she mounted the steps.\\n\\nWhen she entered the room she showed no surprise at seeing Archer\\nthere; surprise seemed the emotion that she was least addicted to.\\n\\n\"How do you like my funny house?\" she asked.  \"To me it\\'s like heaven.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she untied her little velvet bonnet and tossing it away\\nwith her long cloak stood looking at him with meditative eyes.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve arranged it delightfully,\" he rejoined, alive to the flatness\\nof the words, but imprisoned in the conventional by his consuming\\ndesire to be simple and striking.\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s a poor little place.  My relations despise it.  But at any\\nrate it\\'s less gloomy than the van der Luydens\\'.\"\\n\\nThe words gave him an electric shock, for few were the rebellious\\nspirits who would have dared to call the stately home of the van der\\nLuydens gloomy.  Those privileged to enter it shivered there, and spoke\\nof it as \"handsome.\"  But suddenly he was glad that she had given voice\\nto the general shiver.\\n\\n\"It\\'s delicious--what you\\'ve done here,\" he repeated.\\n\\n\"I like the little house,\" she admitted; \"but I suppose what I like is\\nthe blessedness of its being here, in my own country and my own town;\\nand then, of being alone in it.\"  She spoke so low that he hardly heard\\nthe last phrase; but in his awkwardness he took it up.\\n\\n\"You like so much to be alone?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; as long as my friends keep me from feeling lonely.\"  She sat down\\nnear the fire, said:  \"Nastasia will bring the tea presently,\" and\\nsigned to him to return to his armchair, adding:  \"I see you\\'ve already\\nchosen your corner.\"\\n\\nLeaning back, she folded her arms behind her head, and looked at the\\nfire under drooping lids.\\n\\n\"This is the hour I like best--don\\'t you?\"\\n\\nA proper sense of his dignity caused him to answer: \"I was afraid you\\'d\\nforgotten the hour.  Beaufort must have been very engrossing.\"\\n\\nShe looked amused.  \"Why--have you waited long?  Mr. Beaufort took me\\nto see a number of houses--since it seems I\\'m not to be allowed to stay\\nin this one.\"  She appeared to dismiss both Beaufort and himself from\\nher mind, and went on:  \"I\\'ve never been in a city where there seems to\\nbe such a feeling against living in des quartiers excentriques.  What\\ndoes it matter where one lives?  I\\'m told this street is respectable.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not fashionable.\"\\n\\n\"Fashionable!  Do you all think so much of that?  Why not make one\\'s\\nown fashions?  But I suppose I\\'ve lived too independently; at any rate,\\nI want to do what you all do--I want to feel cared for and safe.\"\\n\\nHe was touched, as he had been the evening before when she spoke of her\\nneed of guidance.\\n\\n\"That\\'s what your friends want you to feel.  New York\\'s an awfully safe\\nplace,\" he added with a flash of sarcasm.\\n\\n\"Yes, isn\\'t it?  One feels that,\" she cried, missing the mockery.\\n\"Being here is like--like--being taken on a holiday when one has been a\\ngood little girl and done all one\\'s lessons.\"\\n\\nThe analogy was well meant, but did not altogether please him.  He did\\nnot mind being flippant about New York, but disliked to hear any one\\nelse take the same tone.  He wondered if she did not begin to see what\\na powerful engine it was, and how nearly it had crushed her.  The\\nLovell Mingotts\\' dinner, patched up in extremis out of all sorts of\\nsocial odds and ends, ought to have taught her the narrowness of her\\nescape; but either she had been all along unaware of having skirted\\ndisaster, or else she had lost sight of it in the triumph of the van\\nder Luyden evening.  Archer inclined to the former theory; he fancied\\nthat her New York was still completely undifferentiated, and the\\nconjecture nettled him.\\n\\n\"Last night,\" he said, \"New York laid itself out for you.  The van der\\nLuydens do nothing by halves.\"\\n\\n\"No: how kind they are!  It was such a nice party.  Every one seems to\\nhave such an esteem for them.\"\\n\\nThe terms were hardly adequate; she might have spoken in that way of a\\ntea-party at the dear old Miss Lannings\\'.\\n\\n\"The van der Luydens,\" said Archer, feeling himself pompous as he\\nspoke, \"are the most powerful influence in New York society.\\nUnfortunately--owing to her health--they receive very seldom.\"\\n\\nShe unclasped her hands from behind her head, and looked at him\\nmeditatively.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t that perhaps the reason?\"\\n\\n\"The reason--?\"\\n\\n\"For their great influence; that they make themselves so rare.\"\\n\\nHe coloured a little, stared at her--and suddenly felt the penetration\\nof the remark.  At a stroke she had pricked the van der Luydens and\\nthey collapsed.  He laughed, and sacrificed them.\\n\\nNastasia brought the tea, with handleless Japanese cups and little\\ncovered dishes, placing the tray on a low table.\\n\\n\"But you\\'ll explain these things to me--you\\'ll tell me all I ought to\\nknow,\" Madame Olenska continued, leaning forward to hand him his cup.\\n\\n\"It\\'s you who are telling me; opening my eyes to things I\\'d looked at\\nso long that I\\'d ceased to see them.\"\\n\\nShe detached a small gold cigarette-case from one of her bracelets,\\nheld it out to him, and took a cigarette herself.  On the chimney were\\nlong spills for lighting them.\\n\\n\"Ah, then we can both help each other.  But I want help so much more.\\nYou must tell me just what to do.\"\\n\\nIt was on the tip of his tongue to reply:  \"Don\\'t be seen driving about\\nthe streets with Beaufort--\" but he was being too deeply drawn into the\\natmosphere of the room, which was her atmosphere, and to give advice of\\nthat sort would have been like telling some one who was bargaining for\\nattar-of-roses in Samarkand that one should always be provided with\\narctics for a New York winter.  New York seemed much farther off than\\nSamarkand, and if they were indeed to help each other she was rendering\\nwhat might prove the first of their mutual services by making him look\\nat his native city objectively.  Viewed thus, as through the wrong end\\nof a telescope, it looked disconcertingly small and distant; but then\\nfrom Samarkand it would.\\n\\nA flame darted from the logs and she bent over the fire, stretching her\\nthin hands so close to it that a faint halo shone about the oval nails.\\nThe light touched to russet the rings of dark hair escaping from her\\nbraids, and made her pale face paler.\\n\\n\"There are plenty of people to tell you what to do,\" Archer rejoined,\\nobscurely envious of them.\\n\\n\"Oh--all my aunts?  And my dear old Granny?\"  She considered the idea\\nimpartially.  \"They\\'re all a little vexed with me for setting up for\\nmyself--poor Granny especially.  She wanted to keep me with her; but I\\nhad to be free--\"  He was impressed by this light way of speaking of\\nthe formidable Catherine, and moved by the thought of what must have\\ngiven Madame Olenska this thirst for even the loneliest kind of\\nfreedom.  But the idea of Beaufort gnawed him.\\n\\n\"I think I understand how you feel,\" he said.  \"Still, your family can\\nadvise you; explain differences; show you the way.\"\\n\\nShe lifted her thin black eyebrows.  \"Is New York such a labyrinth?  I\\nthought it so straight up and down--like Fifth Avenue.  And with all\\nthe cross streets numbered!\"  She seemed to guess his faint disapproval\\nof this, and added, with the rare smile that enchanted her whole face:\\n\"If you knew how I like it for just THAT--the straight-up-and-downness,\\nand the big honest labels on everything!\"\\n\\nHe saw his chance.  \"Everything may be labelled--but everybody is not.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps.  I may simplify too much--but you\\'ll warn me if I do.\"  She\\nturned from the fire to look at him.  \"There are only two people here\\nwho make me feel as if they understood what I mean and could explain\\nthings to me: you and Mr. Beaufort.\"\\n\\nArcher winced at the joining of the names, and then, with a quick\\nreadjustment, understood, sympathised and pitied.  So close to the\\npowers of evil she must have lived that she still breathed more freely\\nin their air.  But since she felt that he understood her also, his\\nbusiness would be to make her see Beaufort as he really was, with all\\nhe represented--and abhor it.\\n\\nHe answered gently:  \"I understand.  But just at first don\\'t let go of\\nyour old friends\\' hands: I mean the older women, your Granny Mingott,\\nMrs. Welland, Mrs. van der Luyden.  They like and admire you--they want\\nto help you.\"\\n\\nShe shook her head and sighed.  \"Oh, I know--I know!  But on condition\\nthat they don\\'t hear anything unpleasant.  Aunt Welland put it in those\\nvery words when I tried....  Does no one want to know the truth here,\\nMr. Archer?  The real loneliness is living among all these kind people\\nwho only ask one to pretend!\" She lifted her hands to her face, and he\\nsaw her thin shoulders shaken by a sob.\\n\\n\"Madame Olenska!--Oh, don\\'t, Ellen,\" he cried, starting up and bending\\nover her.  He drew down one of her hands, clasping and chafing it like\\na child\\'s while he murmured reassuring words; but in a moment she freed\\nherself, and looked up at him with wet lashes.\\n\\n\"Does no one cry here, either?  I suppose there\\'s no need to, in\\nheaven,\" she said, straightening her loosened braids with a laugh, and\\nbending over the tea-kettle.  It was burnt into his consciousness that\\nhe had called her \"Ellen\"--called her so twice; and that she had not\\nnoticed it.  Far down the inverted telescope he saw the faint white\\nfigure of May Welland--in New York.\\n\\nSuddenly Nastasia put her head in to say something in her rich Italian.\\n\\nMadame Olenska, again with a hand at her hair, uttered an exclamation\\nof assent--a flashing \"Gia--gia\"--and the Duke of St. Austrey entered,\\npiloting a tremendous blackwigged and red-plumed lady in overflowing\\nfurs.\\n\\n\"My dear Countess, I\\'ve brought an old friend of mine to see you--Mrs.\\nStruthers.  She wasn\\'t asked to the party last night, and she wants to\\nknow you.\"\\n\\nThe Duke beamed on the group, and Madame Olenska advanced with a murmur\\nof welcome toward the queer couple.  She seemed to have no idea how\\noddly matched they were, nor what a liberty the Duke had taken in\\nbringing his companion--and to do him justice, as Archer perceived, the\\nDuke seemed as unaware of it himself.\\n\\n\"Of course I want to know you, my dear,\" cried Mrs. Struthers in a\\nround rolling voice that matched her bold feathers and her brazen wig.\\n\"I want to know everybody who\\'s young and interesting and charming.\\nAnd the Duke tells me you like music--didn\\'t you, Duke?  You\\'re a\\npianist yourself, I believe?  Well, do you want to hear Sarasate play\\ntomorrow evening at my house?  You know I\\'ve something going on every\\nSunday evening--it\\'s the day when New York doesn\\'t know what to do with\\nitself, and so I say to it:  \\'Come and be amused.\\'  And the Duke\\nthought you\\'d be tempted by Sarasate.  You\\'ll find a number of your\\nfriends.\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska\\'s face grew brilliant with pleasure.  \"How kind!  How\\ngood of the Duke to think of me!\" She pushed a chair up to the\\ntea-table and Mrs. Struthers sank into it delectably.  \"Of course I\\nshall be too happy to come.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right, my dear.  And bring your young gentleman with you.\"\\nMrs. Struthers extended a hail-fellow hand to Archer.  \"I can\\'t put a\\nname to you--but I\\'m sure I\\'ve met you--I\\'ve met everybody, here, or in\\nParis or London.  Aren\\'t you in diplomacy?  All the diplomatists come\\nto me.  You like music too?  Duke, you must be sure to bring him.\"\\n\\nThe Duke said \"Rather\" from the depths of his beard, and Archer\\nwithdrew with a stiffly circular bow that made him feel as full of\\nspine as a self-conscious school-boy among careless and unnoticing\\nelders.\\n\\nHe was not sorry for the denouement of his visit: he only wished it had\\ncome sooner, and spared him a certain waste of emotion.  As he went out\\ninto the wintry night, New York again became vast and imminent, and May\\nWelland the loveliest woman in it.  He turned into his florist\\'s to\\nsend her the daily box of lilies-of-the-valley which, to his confusion,\\nhe found he had forgotten that morning.\\n\\nAs he wrote a word on his card and waited for an envelope he glanced\\nabout the embowered shop, and his eye lit on a cluster of yellow roses.\\nHe had never seen any as sun-golden before, and his first impulse was\\nto send them to May instead of the lilies.  But they did not look like\\nher--there was something too rich, too strong, in their fiery beauty.\\nIn a sudden revulsion of mood, and almost without knowing what he did,\\nhe signed to the florist to lay the roses in another long box, and\\nslipped his card into a second envelope, on which he wrote the name of\\nthe Countess Olenska; then, just as he was turning away, he drew the\\ncard out again, and left the empty envelope on the box.\\n\\n\"They\\'ll go at once?\" he enquired, pointing to the roses.\\n\\nThe florist assured him that they would.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

To meet Mrs. and the Misses\\nBlenker.\\n\\n\"Red Gables, Catherine Street.  R. S. V. P.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Good gracious--\" Mr. Welland gasped, as if a second reading had been\\nnecessary to bring the monstrous absurdity of the thing home to him.\\n\\n\"Poor Amy Sillerton--you never can tell what her husband will do next,\"\\nMrs. Welland sighed.  \"I suppose he\\'s just discovered the Blenkers.\"\\n\\nProfessor Emerson Sillerton was a thorn in the side of Newport society;\\nand a thorn that could not be plucked out, for it grew on a venerable\\nand venerated family tree.  He was, as people said, a man who had had\\n\"every advantage.\"  His father was Sillerton Jackson\\'s uncle, his\\nmother a Pennilow of Boston; on each side there was wealth and\\nposition, and mutual suitability.  Nothing--as Mrs. Welland had often\\nremarked--nothing on earth obliged Emerson Sillerton to be an\\narchaeologist, or indeed a Professor of any sort, or to live in Newport\\nin winter, or do any of the other revolutionary things that he did.\\nBut at least, if he was going to break with tradition and flout society\\nin the face, he need not have married poor Amy Dagonet, who had a right\\nto expect \"something different,\" and money enough to keep her own\\ncarriage.\\n\\nNo one in the Mingott set could understand why Amy Sillerton had\\nsubmitted so tamely to the eccentricities of a husband who filled the\\nhouse with long-haired men and short-haired women, and, when he\\ntravelled, took her to explore tombs in Yucatan instead of going to\\nParis or Italy.  But there they were, set in their ways, and apparently\\nunaware that they were different from other people; and when they gave\\none of their dreary annual garden-parties every family on the Cliffs,\\nbecause of the Sillerton-Pennilow-Dagonet connection, had to draw lots\\nand send an unwilling representative.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a wonder,\" Mrs. Welland remarked, \"that they didn\\'t choose the\\nCup Race day!  Do you remember, two years ago, their giving a party for\\na black man on the day of Julia Mingott\\'s the dansant?  Luckily this\\ntime there\\'s nothing else going on that I know of--for of course some\\nof us will have to go.\"\\n\\nMr. Welland sighed nervously.  \"\\'Some of us,\\' my dear--more than one?\\nThree o\\'clock is such a very awkward hour.  I have to be here at\\nhalf-past three to take my drops: it\\'s really no use trying to follow\\nBencomb\\'s new treatment if I don\\'t do it systematically; and if I join\\nyou later, of course I shall miss my drive.\"  At the thought he laid\\ndown his knife and fork again, and a flush of anxiety rose to his\\nfinely-wrinkled cheek.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no reason why you should go at all, my dear,\" his wife\\nanswered with a cheerfulness that had become automatic.  \"I have some\\ncards to leave at the other end of Bellevue Avenue, and I\\'ll drop in at\\nabout half-past three and stay long enough to make poor Amy feel that\\nshe hasn\\'t been slighted.\"  She glanced hesitatingly at her daughter.\\n\"And if Newland\\'s afternoon is provided for perhaps May can drive you\\nout with the ponies, and try their new russet harness.\"\\n\\nIt was a principle in the Welland family that people\\'s days and hours\\nshould be what Mrs. Welland called \"provided for.\"  The melancholy\\npossibility of having to \"kill time\" (especially for those who did not\\ncare for whist or solitaire) was a vision that haunted her as the\\nspectre of the unemployed haunts the philanthropist.  Another of her\\nprinciples was that parents should never (at least visibly) interfere\\nwith the plans of their married children; and the difficulty of\\nadjusting this respect for May\\'s independence with the exigency of Mr.\\nWelland\\'s claims could be overcome only by the exercise of an ingenuity\\nwhich left not a second of Mrs. Welland\\'s own time unprovided for.\\n\\n\"Of course I\\'ll drive with Papa--I\\'m sure Newland will find something\\nto do,\" May said, in a tone that gently reminded her husband of his\\nlack of response.  It was a cause of constant distress to Mrs. Welland\\nthat her son-in-law showed so little foresight in planning his days.\\nOften already, during the fortnight that he had passed under her roof,\\nwhen she enquired how he meant to spend his afternoon, he had answered\\nparadoxically:  \"Oh, I think for a change I\\'ll just save it instead of\\nspending it--\" and once, when she and May had had to go on a\\nlong-postponed round of afternoon calls, he had confessed to having\\nlain all the afternoon under a rock on the beach below the house.\\n\\n\"Newland never seems to look ahead,\" Mrs. Welland once ventured to\\ncomplain to her daughter; and May answered serenely:  \"No; but you see\\nit doesn\\'t matter, because when there\\'s nothing particular to do he\\nreads a book.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, yes--like his father!\" Mrs. Welland agreed, as if allowing for an\\ninherited oddity; and after that the question of Newland\\'s unemployment\\nwas tacitly dropped.\\n\\nNevertheless, as the day for the Sillerton reception approached, May\\nbegan to show a natural solicitude for his welfare, and to suggest a\\ntennis match at the Chiverses\\', or a sail on Julius Beaufort\\'s cutter,\\nas a means of atoning for her temporary desertion.  \"I shall be back by\\nsix, you know, dear: Papa never drives later than that--\" and she was\\nnot reassured till Archer said that he thought of hiring a run-about\\nand driving up the island to a stud-farm to look at a second horse for\\nher brougham.  They had been looking for this horse for some time, and\\nthe suggestion was so acceptable that May glanced at her mother as if\\nto say:  \"You see he knows how to plan out his time as well as any of\\nus.\"\\n\\nThe idea of the stud-farm and the brougham horse had germinated in\\nArcher\\'s mind on the very day when the Emerson Sillerton invitation had\\nfirst been mentioned; but he had kept it to himself as if there were\\nsomething clandestine in the plan, and discovery might prevent its\\nexecution.  He had, however, taken the precaution to engage in advance\\na runabout with a pair of old livery-stable trotters that could still\\ndo their eighteen miles on level roads; and at two o\\'clock, hastily\\ndeserting the luncheon-table, he sprang into the light carriage and\\ndrove off.\\n\\nThe day was perfect.  A breeze from the north drove little puffs of\\nwhite cloud across an ultramarine sky, with a bright sea running under\\nit.  Bellevue Avenue was empty at that hour, and after dropping the\\nstable-lad at the corner of Mill Street Archer turned down the Old\\nBeach Road and drove across Eastman\\'s Beach.\\n\\nHe had the feeling of unexplained excitement with which, on\\nhalf-holidays at school, he used to start off into the unknown.  Taking\\nhis pair at an easy gait, he counted on reaching the stud-farm, which\\nwas not far beyond Paradise Rocks, before three o\\'clock; so that, after\\nlooking over the horse (and trying him if he seemed promising) he would\\nstill have four golden hours to dispose of.\\n\\nAs soon as he heard of the Sillerton\\'s party he had said to himself\\nthat the Marchioness Manson would certainly come to Newport with the\\nBlenkers, and that Madame Olenska might again take the opportunity of\\nspending the day with her grandmother.  At any rate, the Blenker\\nhabitation would probably be deserted, and he would be able, without\\nindiscretion, to satisfy a vague curiosity concerning it.  He was not\\nsure that he wanted to see the Countess Olenska again; but ever since\\nhe had looked at her from the path above the bay he had wanted,\\nirrationally and indescribably, to see the place she was living in, and\\nto follow the movements of her imagined figure as he had watched the\\nreal one in the summer-house.  The longing was with him day and night,\\nan incessant undefinable craving, like the sudden whim of a sick man\\nfor food or drink once tasted and long since forgotten.  He could not\\nsee beyond the craving, or picture what it might lead to, for he was\\nnot conscious of any wish to speak to Madame Olenska or to hear her\\nvoice.  He simply felt that if he could carry away the vision of the\\nspot of earth she walked on, and the way the sky and sea enclosed it,\\nthe rest of the world might seem less empty.\\n\\nWhen he reached the stud-farm a glance showed him that the horse was\\nnot what he wanted; nevertheless he took a turn behind it in order to\\nprove to himself that he was not in a hurry.  But at three o\\'clock he\\nshook out the reins over the trotters and turned into the by-roads\\nleading to Portsmouth.  The wind had dropped and a faint haze on the\\nhorizon showed that a fog was waiting to steal up the Saconnet on the\\nturn of the tide; but all about him fields and woods were steeped in\\ngolden light.\\n\\nHe drove past grey-shingled farm-houses in orchards, past hay-fields\\nand groves of oak, past villages with white steeples rising sharply\\ninto the fading sky; and at last, after stopping to ask the way of some\\nmen at work in a field, he turned down a lane between high banks of\\ngoldenrod and brambles.  At the end of the lane was the blue glimmer of\\nthe river; to the left, standing in front of a clump of oaks and\\nmaples, he saw a long tumble-down house with white paint peeling from\\nits clapboards.\\n\\nOn the road-side facing the gateway stood one of the open sheds in\\nwhich the New Englander shelters his farming implements and visitors\\n\"hitch\" their \"teams.\" Archer, jumping down, led his pair into the\\nshed, and after tying them to a post turned toward the house.  The\\npatch of lawn before it had relapsed into a hay-field; but to the left\\nan overgrown box-garden full of dahlias and rusty rose-bushes encircled\\na ghostly summer-house of trellis-work that had once been white,\\nsurmounted by a wooden Cupid who had lost his bow and arrow but\\ncontinued to take ineffectual aim.\\n\\nArcher leaned for a while against the gate.  No one was in sight, and\\nnot a sound came from the open windows of the house: a grizzled\\nNewfoundland dozing before the door seemed as ineffectual a guardian as\\nthe arrowless Cupid.  It was strange to think that this place of\\nsilence and decay was the home of the turbulent Blenkers; yet Archer\\nwas sure that he was not mistaken.\\n\\nFor a long time he stood there, content to take in the scene, and\\ngradually falling under its drowsy spell; but at length he roused\\nhimself to the sense of the passing time.  Should he look his fill and\\nthen drive away?  He stood irresolute, wishing suddenly to see the\\ninside of the house, so that he might picture the room that Madame\\nOlenska sat in.  There was nothing to prevent his walking up to the\\ndoor and ringing the bell; if, as he supposed, she was away with the\\nrest of the party, he could easily give his name, and ask permission to\\ngo into the sitting-room to write a message.\\n\\nBut instead, he crossed the lawn and turned toward the box-garden.  As\\nhe entered it he caught sight of something bright-coloured in the\\nsummer-house, and presently made it out to be a pink parasol.  The\\nparasol drew him like a magnet: he was sure it was hers.  He went into\\nthe summer-house, and sitting down on the rickety seat picked up the\\nsilken thing and looked at its carved handle, which was made of some\\nrare wood that gave out an aromatic scent.  Archer lifted the handle to\\nhis lips.\\n\\nHe heard a rustle of skirts against the box, and sat motionless,\\nleaning on the parasol handle with clasped hands, and letting the\\nrustle come nearer without lifting his eyes.  He had always known that\\nthis must happen ...\\n\\n\"Oh, Mr. Archer!\" exclaimed a loud young voice; and looking up he saw\\nbefore him the youngest and largest of the Blenker girls, blonde and\\nblowsy, in bedraggled muslin.  A red blotch on one of her cheeks seemed\\nto show that it had recently been pressed against a pillow, and her\\nhalf-awakened eyes stared at him hospitably but confusedly.\\n\\n\"Gracious--where did you drop from?  I must have been sound asleep in\\nthe hammock.  Everybody else has gone to Newport.  Did you ring?\" she\\nincoherently enquired.\\n\\nArcher\\'s confusion was greater than hers.  \"I--no--that is, I was just\\ngoing to.  I had to come up the island to see about a horse, and I\\ndrove over on a chance of finding Mrs. Blenker and your visitors.  But\\nthe house seemed empty--so I sat down to wait.\"\\n\\nMiss Blenker, shaking off the fumes of sleep, looked at him with\\nincreasing interest.  \"The house IS empty.  Mother\\'s not here, or the\\nMarchioness--or anybody but me.\"  Her glance became faintly\\nreproachful.  \"Didn\\'t you know that Professor and Mrs. Sillerton are\\ngiving a garden-party for mother and all of us this afternoon?  It was\\ntoo unlucky that I couldn\\'t go; but I\\'ve had a sore throat, and mother\\nwas afraid of the drive home this evening.  Did you ever know anything\\nso disappointing?  Of course,\" she added gaily, \"I shouldn\\'t have\\nminded half as much if I\\'d known you were coming.\"\\n\\nSymptoms of a lumbering coquetry became visible in her, and Archer\\nfound the strength to break in:  \"But Madame Olenska--has she gone to\\nNewport too?\"\\n\\nMiss Blenker looked at him with surprise.  \"Madame Olenska--didn\\'t you\\nknow she\\'d been called away?\"\\n\\n\"Called away?--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, my best parasol!  I lent it to that goose of a Katie, because it\\nmatched her ribbons, and the careless thing must have dropped it here.\\nWe Blenkers are all like that ... real Bohemians!\"  Recovering the\\nsunshade with a powerful hand she unfurled it and suspended its rosy\\ndome above her head.  \"Yes, Ellen was called away yesterday: she lets\\nus call her Ellen, you know.  A telegram came from Boston: she said she\\nmight be gone for two days.  I do LOVE the way she does her hair, don\\'t\\nyou?\" Miss Blenker rambled on.\\n\\nArcher continued to stare through her as though she had been\\ntransparent.  All he saw was the trumpery parasol that arched its\\npinkness above her giggling head.\\n\\nAfter a moment he ventured:  \"You don\\'t happen to know why Madame\\nOlenska went to Boston?  I hope it was not on account of bad news?\"\\n\\nMiss Blenker took this with a cheerful incredulity.  \"Oh, I don\\'t\\nbelieve so.  She didn\\'t tell us what was in the telegram.  I think she\\ndidn\\'t want the Marchioness to know.  She\\'s so romantic-looking, isn\\'t\\nshe?  Doesn\\'t she remind you of Mrs. Scott-Siddons when she reads \\'Lady\\nGeraldine\\'s Courtship\\'?  Did you never hear her?\"\\n\\nArcher was dealing hurriedly with crowding thoughts.  His whole future\\nseemed suddenly to be unrolled before him; and passing down its endless\\nemptiness he saw the dwindling figure of a man to whom nothing was ever\\nto happen.  He glanced about him at the unpruned garden, the\\ntumble-down house, and the oak-grove under which the dusk was\\ngathering.  It had seemed so exactly the place in which he ought to\\nhave found Madame Olenska; and she was far away, and even the pink\\nsunshade was not hers ...\\n\\nHe frowned and hesitated.  \"You don\\'t know, I suppose--I shall be in\\nBoston tomorrow.  If I could manage to see her--\"\\n\\nHe felt that Miss Blenker was losing interest in him, though her smile\\npersisted.  \"Oh, of course; how lovely of you!  She\\'s staying at the\\nParker House; it must be horrible there in this weather.\"\\n\\nAfter that Archer was but intermittently aware of the remarks they\\nexchanged.  He could only remember stoutly resisting her entreaty that\\nhe should await the returning family and have high tea with them before\\nhe drove home.  At length, with his hostess still at his side, he\\npassed out of range of the wooden Cupid, unfastened his horses and\\ndrove off.  At the turn of the lane he saw Miss Blenker standing at the\\ngate and waving the pink parasol.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nEvery year on the fifteenth of October Fifth Avenue opened its\\nshutters, unrolled its carpets and hung up its triple layer of\\nwindow-curtains.\\n\\nBy the first of November this household ritual was over, and society\\nhad begun to look about and take stock of itself.  By the fifteenth the\\nseason was in full blast, Opera and theatres were putting forth their\\nnew attractions, dinner-engagements were accumulating, and dates for\\ndances being fixed.  And punctually at about this time Mrs. Archer\\nalways said that New York was very much changed.\\n\\nObserving it from the lofty stand-point of a non-participant, she was\\nable, with the help of Mr. Sillerton Jackson and Miss Sophy, to trace\\neach new crack in its surface, and all the strange weeds pushing up\\nbetween the ordered rows of social vegetables.  It had been one of the\\namusements of Archer\\'s youth to wait for this annual pronouncement of\\nhis mother\\'s, and to hear her enumerate the minute signs of\\ndisintegration that his careless gaze had overlooked.  For New York, to\\nMrs. Archer\\'s mind, never changed without changing for the worse; and\\nin this view Miss Sophy Jackson heartily concurred.\\n\\nMr. Sillerton Jackson, as became a man of the world, suspended his\\njudgment and listened with an amused impartiality to the lamentations\\nof the ladies.  But even he never denied that New York had changed; and\\nNewland Archer, in the winter of the second year of his marriage, was\\nhimself obliged to admit that if it had not actually changed it was\\ncertainly changing.\\n\\nThese points had been raised, as usual, at Mrs. Archer\\'s Thanksgiving\\ndinner.  At the date when she was officially enjoined to give thanks\\nfor the blessings of the year it was her habit to take a mournful\\nthough not embittered stock of her world, and wonder what there was to\\nbe thankful for.  At any rate, not the state of society; society, if it\\ncould be said to exist, was rather a spectacle on which to call down\\nBiblical imprecations--and in fact, every one knew what the Reverend\\nDr. Ashmore meant when he chose a text from Jeremiah (chap. ii., verse\\n25) for his Thanksgiving sermon.  Dr. Ashmore, the new Rector of St.\\nMatthew\\'s, had been chosen because he was very \"advanced\": his sermons\\nwere considered bold in thought and novel in language.  When he\\nfulminated against fashionable society he always spoke of its \"trend\";\\nand to Mrs. Archer it was terrifying and yet fascinating to feel\\nherself part of a community that was trending.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no doubt that Dr. Ashmore is right: there IS a marked trend,\"\\nshe said, as if it were something visible and measurable, like a crack\\nin a house.\\n\\n\"It was odd, though, to preach about it on Thanksgiving,\" Miss Jackson\\nopined; and her hostess drily rejoined:  \"Oh, he means us to give\\nthanks for what\\'s left.\"\\n\\nArcher had been wont to smile at these annual vaticinations of his\\nmother\\'s; but this year even he was obliged to acknowledge, as he\\nlistened to an enumeration of the changes, that the \"trend\" was visible.\\n\\n\"The extravagance in dress--\" Miss Jackson began.  \"Sillerton took me\\nto the first night of the Opera, and I can only tell you that Jane\\nMerry\\'s dress was the only one I recognised from last year; and even\\nthat had had the front panel changed.  Yet I know she got it out from\\nWorth only two years ago, because my seamstress always goes in to make\\nover her Paris dresses before she wears them.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, Jane Merry is one of US,\" said Mrs. Archer sighing, as if it were\\nnot such an enviable thing to be in an age when ladies were beginning\\nto flaunt abroad their Paris dresses as soon as they were out of the\\nCustom House, instead of letting them mellow under lock and key, in the\\nmanner of Mrs. Archer\\'s contemporaries.\\n\\n\"Yes; she\\'s one of the few.  In my youth,\" Miss Jackson rejoined, \"it\\nwas considered vulgar to dress in the newest fashions; and Amy\\nSillerton has always told me that in Boston the rule was to put away\\none\\'s Paris dresses for two years.  Old Mrs. Baxter Pennilow, who did\\neverything handsomely, used to import twelve a year, two velvet, two\\nsatin, two silk, and the other six of poplin and the finest cashmere.\\nIt was a standing order, and as she was ill for two years before she\\ndied they found forty-eight Worth dresses that had never been taken out\\nof tissue paper; and when the girls left off their mourning they were\\nable to wear the first lot at the Symphony concerts without looking in\\nadvance of the fashion.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, well, Boston is more conservative than New York; but I always\\nthink it\\'s a safe rule for a lady to lay aside her French dresses for\\none season,\" Mrs. Archer conceded.\\n\\n\"It was Beaufort who started the new fashion by making his wife clap\\nher new clothes on her back as soon as they arrived: I must say at\\ntimes it takes all Regina\\'s distinction not to look like ... like ...\"\\nMiss Jackson glanced around the table, caught Janey\\'s bulging gaze, and\\ntook refuge in an unintelligible murmur.\\n\\n\"Like her rivals,\" said Mr. Sillerton Jackson, with the air of\\nproducing an epigram.\\n\\n\"Oh,--\" the ladies murmured; and Mrs. Archer added, partly to distract\\nher daughter\\'s attention from forbidden topics:  \"Poor Regina!  Her\\nThanksgiving hasn\\'t been a very cheerful one, I\\'m afraid.  Have you\\nheard the rumours about Beaufort\\'s speculations, Sillerton?\"\\n\\nMr. Jackson nodded carelessly.  Every one had heard the rumours in\\nquestion, and he scorned to confirm a tale that was already common\\nproperty.\\n\\nA gloomy silence fell upon the party.  No one really liked Beaufort,\\nand it was not wholly unpleasant to think the worst of his private\\nlife; but the idea of his having brought financial dishonour on his\\nwife\\'s family was too shocking to be enjoyed even by his enemies.\\nArcher\\'s New York tolerated hypocrisy in private relations; but in\\nbusiness matters it exacted a limpid and impeccable honesty.  It was a\\nlong time since any well-known banker had failed discreditably; but\\nevery one remembered the social extinction visited on the heads of the\\nfirm when the last event of the kind had happened.  It would be the\\nsame with the Beauforts, in spite of his power and her popularity; not\\nall the leagued strength of the Dallas connection would save poor\\nRegina if there were any truth in the reports of her husband\\'s unlawful\\nspeculations.\\n\\nThe talk took refuge in less ominous topics; but everything they\\ntouched on seemed to confirm Mrs. Archer\\'s sense of an accelerated\\ntrend.\\n\\n\"Of course, Newland, I know you let dear May go to Mrs. Struthers\\'s\\nSunday evenings--\" she began; and May interposed gaily:  \"Oh, you know,\\neverybody goes to Mrs. Struthers\\'s now; and she was invited to Granny\\'s\\nlast reception.\"\\n\\nIt was thus, Archer reflected, that New York managed its transitions:\\nconspiring to ignore them till they were well over, and then, in all\\ngood faith, imagining that they had taken place in a preceding age.\\nThere was always a traitor in the citadel; and after he (or generally\\nshe) had surrendered the keys, what was the use of pretending that it\\nwas impregnable?  Once people had tasted of Mrs. Struthers\\'s easy\\nSunday hospitality they were not likely to sit at home remembering that\\nher champagne was transmuted Shoe-Polish.\\n\\n\"I know, dear, I know,\" Mrs. Archer sighed.  \"Such things have to be, I\\nsuppose, as long as AMUSEMENT is what people go out for; but I\\'ve never\\nquite forgiven your cousin Madame Olenska for being the first person to\\ncountenance Mrs. Struthers.\"\\n\\nA sudden blush rose to young Mrs. Archer\\'s face; it surprised her\\nhusband as much as the other guests about the table.  \"Oh, ELLEN--\" she\\nmurmured, much in the same accusing and yet deprecating tone in which\\nher parents might have said:  \"Oh, THE BLENKERS--.\"\\n\\nIt was the note which the family had taken to sounding on the mention\\nof the Countess Olenska\\'s name, since she had surprised and\\ninconvenienced them by remaining obdurate to her husband\\'s advances;\\nbut on May\\'s lips it gave food for thought, and Archer looked at her\\nwith the sense of strangeness that sometimes came over him when she was\\nmost in the tone of her environment.\\n\\nHis mother, with less than her usual sensitiveness to atmosphere, still\\ninsisted:  \"I\\'ve always thought that people like the Countess Olenska,\\nwho have lived in aristocratic societies, ought to help us to keep up\\nour social distinctions, instead of ignoring them.\"\\n\\nMay\\'s blush remained permanently vivid: it seemed to have a\\nsignificance beyond that implied by the recognition of Madame Olenska\\'s\\nsocial bad faith.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve no doubt we all seem alike to foreigners,\" said Miss Jackson\\ntartly.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think Ellen cares for society; but nobody knows exactly what\\nshe does care for,\" May continued, as if she had been groping for\\nsomething noncommittal.\\n\\n\"Ah, well--\" Mrs. Archer sighed again.\\n\\nEverybody knew that the Countess Olenska was no longer in the good\\ngraces of her family.  Even her devoted champion, old Mrs. Manson\\nMingott, had been unable to defend her refusal to return to her\\nhusband.  The Mingotts had not proclaimed their disapproval aloud:\\ntheir sense of solidarity was too strong.  They had simply, as Mrs.\\nWelland said, \"let poor Ellen find her own level\"--and that,\\nmortifyingly and incomprehensibly, was in the dim depths where the\\nBlenkers prevailed, and \"people who wrote\" celebrated their untidy\\nrites.  It was incredible, but it was a fact, that Ellen, in spite of\\nall her opportunities and her privileges, had become simply \"Bohemian.\"\\nThe fact enforced the contention that she had made a fatal mistake in\\nnot returning to Count Olenski.  After all, a young woman\\'s place was\\nunder her husband\\'s roof, especially when she had left it in\\ncircumstances that ... well ... if one had cared to look into them ...\\n\\n\"Madame Olenska is a great favourite with the gentlemen,\" said Miss\\nSophy, with her air of wishing to put forth something conciliatory when\\nshe knew that she was planting a dart.\\n\\n\"Ah, that\\'s the danger that a young woman like Madame Olenska is always\\nexposed to,\" Mrs. Archer mournfully agreed; and the ladies, on this\\nconclusion, gathered up their trains to seek the carcel globes of the\\ndrawing-room, while Archer and Mr. Sillerton Jackson withdrew to the\\nGothic library.\\n\\nOnce established before the grate, and consoling himself for the\\ninadequacy of the dinner by the perfection of his cigar, Mr. Jackson\\nbecame portentous and communicable.\\n\\n\"If the Beaufort smash comes,\" he announced, \"there are going to be\\ndisclosures.\"\\n\\nArcher raised his head quickly: he could never hear the name without\\nthe sharp vision of Beaufort\\'s heavy figure, opulently furred and shod,\\nadvancing through the snow at Skuytercliff.\\n\\n\"There\\'s bound to be,\" Mr. Jackson continued, \"the nastiest kind of a\\ncleaning up.  He hasn\\'t spent all his money on Regina.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, well--that\\'s discounted, isn\\'t it?  My belief is he\\'ll pull out\\nyet,\" said the young man, wanting to change the subject.\\n\\n\"Perhaps--perhaps.  I know he was to see some of the influential people\\ntoday.  Of course,\" Mr. Jackson reluctantly conceded, \"it\\'s to be hoped\\nthey can tide him over--this time anyhow.  I shouldn\\'t like to think of\\npoor Regina\\'s spending the rest of her life in some shabby foreign\\nwatering-place for bankrupts.\"\\n\\nArcher said nothing.  It seemed to him so natural--however tragic--that\\nmoney ill-gotten should be cruelly expiated, that his mind, hardly\\nlingering over Mrs. Beaufort\\'s doom, wandered back to closer questions.\\nWhat was the meaning of May\\'s blush when the Countess Olenska had been\\nmentioned?\\n\\nFour months had passed since the midsummer day that he and Madame\\nOlenska had spent together; and since then he had not seen her.  He\\nknew that she had returned to Washington, to the little house which she\\nand Medora Manson had taken there: he had written to her once--a few\\nwords, asking when they were to meet again--and she had even more\\nbriefly replied: \"Not yet.\"\\n\\nSince then there had been no farther communication between them, and he\\nhad built up within himself a kind of sanctuary in which she throned\\namong his secret thoughts and longings.  Little by little it became the\\nscene of his real life, of his only rational activities; thither he\\nbrought the books he read, the ideas and feelings which nourished him,\\nhis judgments and his visions.  Outside it, in the scene of his actual\\nlife, he moved with a growing sense of unreality and insufficiency,\\nblundering against familiar prejudices and traditional points of view\\nas an absent-minded man goes on bumping into the furniture of his own\\nroom.  Absent--that was what he was: so absent from everything most\\ndensely real and near to those about him that it sometimes startled him\\nto find they still imagined he was there.\\n\\nHe became aware that Mr. Jackson was clearing his throat preparatory to\\nfarther revelations.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, of course, how far your wife\\'s family are aware of what\\npeople say about--well, about Madame Olenska\\'s refusal to accept her\\nhusband\\'s latest offer.\"\\n\\nArcher was silent, and Mr. Jackson obliquely continued: \"It\\'s a\\npity--it\\'s certainly a pity--that she refused it.\"\\n\\n\"A pity?  In God\\'s name, why?\"\\n\\nMr. Jackson looked down his leg to the unwrinkled sock that joined it\\nto a glossy pump.\\n\\n\"Well--to put it on the lowest ground--what\\'s she going to live on now?\"\\n\\n\"Now--?\"\\n\\n\"If Beaufort--\"\\n\\nArcher sprang up, his fist banging down on the black walnut-edge of the\\nwriting-table.  The wells of the brass double-inkstand danced in their\\nsockets.\\n\\n\"What the devil do you mean, sir?\"\\n\\nMr. Jackson, shifting himself slightly in his chair, turned a tranquil\\ngaze on the young man\\'s burning face.\\n\\n\"Well--I have it on pretty good authority--in fact, on old Catherine\\'s\\nherself--that the family reduced Countess Olenska\\'s allowance\\nconsiderably when she definitely refused to go back to her husband; and\\nas, by this refusal, she also forfeits the money settled on her when\\nshe married--which Olenski was ready to make over to her if she\\nreturned--why, what the devil do YOU mean, my dear boy, by asking me\\nwhat I mean?\" Mr. Jackson good-humouredly retorted.\\n\\nArcher moved toward the mantelpiece and bent over to knock his ashes\\ninto the grate.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know anything of Madame Olenska\\'s private affairs; but I don\\'t\\nneed to, to be certain that what you insinuate--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t: it\\'s Lefferts, for one,\" Mr. Jackson interposed.\\n\\n\"Lefferts--who made love to her and got snubbed for it!\" Archer broke\\nout contemptuously.\\n\\n\"Ah--DID he?\" snapped the other, as if this were exactly the fact he\\nhad been laying a trap for.  He still sat sideways from the fire, so\\nthat his hard old gaze held Archer\\'s face as if in a spring of steel.\\n\\n\"Well, well: it\\'s a pity she didn\\'t go back before Beaufort\\'s cropper,\"\\nhe repeated.  \"If she goes NOW, and if he fails, it will only confirm\\nthe general impression: which isn\\'t by any means peculiar to Lefferts,\\nby the way.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, she won\\'t go back now: less than ever!\"  Archer had no sooner said\\nit than he had once more the feeling that it was exactly what Mr.\\nJackson had been waiting for.\\n\\nThe old gentleman considered him attentively.  \"That\\'s your opinion,\\neh?  Well, no doubt you know.  But everybody will tell you that the few\\npennies Medora Manson has left are all in Beaufort\\'s hands; and how the\\ntwo women are to keep their heads above water unless he does, I can\\'t\\nimagine.  Of course, Madame Olenska may still soften old Catherine,\\nwho\\'s been the most inexorably opposed to her staying; and old\\nCatherine could make her any allowance she chooses.  But we all know\\nthat she hates parting with good money; and the rest of the family have\\nno particular interest in keeping Madame Olenska here.\"\\n\\nArcher was burning with unavailing wrath: he was exactly in the state\\nwhen a man is sure to do something stupid, knowing all the while that\\nhe is doing it.\\n\\nHe saw that Mr. Jackson had been instantly struck by the fact that\\nMadame Olenska\\'s differences with her grandmother and her other\\nrelations were not known to him, and that the old gentleman had drawn\\nhis own conclusions as to the reasons for Archer\\'s exclusion from the\\nfamily councils.  This fact warned Archer to go warily; but the\\ninsinuations about Beaufort made him reckless.  He was mindful,\\nhowever, if not of his own danger, at least of the fact that Mr.\\nJackson was under his mother\\'s roof, and consequently his guest.  Old\\nNew York scrupulously observed the etiquette of hospitality, and no\\ndiscussion with a guest was ever allowed to degenerate into a\\ndisagreement.\\n\\n\"Shall we go up and join my mother?\" he suggested curtly, as Mr.\\nJackson\\'s last cone of ashes dropped into the brass ashtray at his\\nelbow.\\n\\nOn the drive homeward May remained oddly silent; through the darkness,\\nhe still felt her enveloped in her menacing blush.  What its menace\\nmeant he could not guess: but he was sufficiently warned by the fact\\nthat Madame Olenska\\'s name had evoked it.\\n\\nThey went upstairs, and he turned into the library.  She usually\\nfollowed him; but he heard her passing down the passage to her bedroom.\\n\\n\"May!\" he called out impatiently; and she came back, with a slight\\nglance of surprise at his tone.\\n\\n\"This lamp is smoking again; I should think the servants might see that\\nit\\'s kept properly trimmed,\" he grumbled nervously.\\n\\n\"I\\'m so sorry: it shan\\'t happen again,\" she answered, in the firm\\nbright tone she had learned from her mother; and it exasperated Archer\\nto feel that she was already beginning to humour him like a younger Mr.\\nWelland.  She bent over to lower the wick, and as the light struck up\\non her white shoulders and the clear curves of her face he thought:\\n\"How young she is!  For what endless years this life will have to go\\non!\"\\n\\nHe felt, with a kind of horror, his own strong youth and the bounding\\nblood in his veins.  \"Look here,\" he said suddenly, \"I may have to go\\nto Washington for a few days--soon; next week perhaps.\"\\n\\nHer hand remained on the key of the lamp as she turned to him slowly.\\nThe heat from its flame had brought back a glow to her face, but it\\npaled as she looked up.\\n\\n\"On business?\" she asked, in a tone which implied that there could be\\nno other conceivable reason, and that she had put the question\\nautomatically, as if merely to finish his own sentence.\\n\\n\"On business, naturally.  There\\'s a patent case coming up before the\\nSupreme Court--\"  He gave the name of the inventor, and went on\\nfurnishing details with all Lawrence Lefferts\\'s practised glibness,\\nwhile she listened attentively, saying at intervals:  \"Yes, I see.\"\\n\\n\"The change will do you good,\" she said simply, when he had finished;\\n\"and you must be sure to go and see Ellen,\" she added, looking him\\nstraight in the eyes with her cloudless smile, and speaking in the tone\\nshe might have employed in urging him not to neglect some irksome\\nfamily duty.\\n\\nIt was the only word that passed between them on the subject; but in\\nthe code in which they had both been trained it meant:  \"Of course you\\nunderstand that I know all that people have been saying about Ellen,\\nand heartily sympathise with my family in their effort to get her to\\nreturn to her husband.  I also know that, for some reason you have not\\nchosen to tell me, you have advised her against this course, which all\\nthe older men of the family, as well as our grandmother, agree in\\napproving; and that it is owing to your encouragement that Ellen defies\\nus all, and exposes herself to the kind of criticism of which Mr.\\nSillerton Jackson probably gave you, this evening, the hint that has\\nmade you so irritable....  Hints have indeed not been wanting; but\\nsince you appear unwilling to take them from others, I offer you this\\none myself, in the only form in which well-bred people of our kind can\\ncommunicate unpleasant things to each other: by letting you understand\\nthat I know you mean to see Ellen when you are in Washington, and are\\nperhaps going there expressly for that purpose; and that, since you are\\nsure to see her, I wish you to do so with my full and explicit\\napproval--and to take the opportunity of letting her know what the\\ncourse of conduct you have encouraged her in is likely to lead to.\"\\n\\nHer hand was still on the key of the lamp when the last word of this\\nmute message reached him.  She turned the wick down, lifted off the\\nglobe, and breathed on the sulky flame.\\n\\n\"They smell less if one blows them out,\" she explained, with her bright\\nhousekeeping air.  On the threshold she turned and paused for his kiss.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              " [{'chapter-content': '\\nThe small bright lawn stretched away smoothly to the big bright sea.\\n\\nThe turf was hemmed with an edge of scarlet geranium and coleus, and\\ncast-iron vases painted in chocolate colour, standing at intervals\\nalong the winding path that led to the sea, looped their garlands of\\npetunia and ivy geranium above the neatly raked gravel.\\n\\nHalf way between the edge of the cliff and the square wooden house\\n(which was also chocolate-coloured, but with the tin roof of the\\nverandah striped in yellow and brown to represent an awning) two large\\ntargets had been placed against a background of shrubbery.  On the\\nother side of the lawn, facing the targets, was pitched a real tent,\\nwith benches and garden-seats about it.  A number of ladies in summer\\ndresses and gentlemen in grey frock-coats and tall hats stood on the\\nlawn or sat upon the benches; and every now and then a slender girl in\\nstarched muslin would step from the tent, bow in hand, and speed her\\nshaft at one of the targets, while the spectators interrupted their\\ntalk to watch the result.\\n\\nNewland Archer, standing on the verandah of the house, looked curiously\\ndown upon this scene.  On each side of the shiny painted steps was a\\nlarge blue china flower-pot on a bright yellow china stand.  A spiky\\ngreen plant filled each pot, and below the verandah ran a wide border\\nof blue hydrangeas edged with more red geraniums.  Behind him, the\\nFrench windows of the drawing-rooms through which he had passed gave\\nglimpses, between swaying lace curtains, of glassy parquet floors\\nislanded with chintz poufs, dwarf armchairs, and velvet tables covered\\nwith trifles in silver.\\n\\nThe Newport Archery Club always held its August meeting at the\\nBeauforts\\'.  The sport, which had hitherto known no rival but croquet,\\nwas beginning to be discarded in favour of lawn-tennis; but the latter\\ngame was still considered too rough and inelegant for social occasions,\\nand as an opportunity to show off pretty dresses and graceful attitudes\\nthe bow and arrow held their own.\\n\\nArcher looked down with wonder at the familiar spectacle.  It surprised\\nhim that life should be going on in the old way when his own reactions\\nto it had so completely changed.  It was Newport that had first brought\\nhome to him the extent of the change.  In New York, during the previous\\nwinter, after he and May had settled down in the new greenish-yellow\\nhouse with the bow-window and the Pompeian vestibule, he had dropped\\nback with relief into the old routine of the office, and the renewal of\\nthis daily activity had served as a link with his former self.  Then\\nthere had been the pleasurable excitement of choosing a showy grey\\nstepper for May\\'s brougham (the Wellands had given the carriage), and\\nthe abiding occupation and interest of arranging his new library,\\nwhich, in spite of family doubts and disapprovals, had been carried out\\nas he had dreamed, with a dark embossed paper, Eastlake book-cases and\\n\"sincere\" arm-chairs and tables.  At the Century he had found Winsett\\nagain, and at the Knickerbocker the fashionable young men of his own\\nset; and what with the hours dedicated to the law and those given to\\ndining out or entertaining friends at home, with an occasional evening\\nat the Opera or the play, the life he was living had still seemed a\\nfairly real and inevitable sort of business.\\n\\nBut Newport represented the escape from duty into an atmosphere of\\nunmitigated holiday-making.  Archer had tried to persuade May to spend\\nthe summer on a remote island off the coast of Maine (called,\\nappropriately enough, Mount Desert), where a few hardy Bostonians and\\nPhiladelphians were camping in \"native\" cottages, and whence came\\nreports of enchanting scenery and a wild, almost trapper-like existence\\namid woods and waters.\\n\\nBut the Wellands always went to Newport, where they owned one of the\\nsquare boxes on the cliffs, and their son-in-law could adduce no good\\nreason why he and May should not join them there.  As Mrs. Welland\\nrather tartly pointed out, it was hardly worth while for May to have\\nworn herself out trying on summer clothes in Paris if she was not to be\\nallowed to wear them; and this argument was of a kind to which Archer\\nhad as yet found no answer.\\n\\nMay herself could not understand his obscure reluctance to fall in with\\nso reasonable and pleasant a way of spending the summer.  She reminded\\nhim that he had always liked Newport in his bachelor days, and as this\\nwas indisputable he could only profess that he was sure he was going to\\nlike it better than ever now that they were to be there together.  But\\nas he stood on the Beaufort verandah and looked out on the brightly\\npeopled lawn it came home to him with a shiver that he was not going to\\nlike it at all.\\n\\nIt was not May\\'s fault, poor dear.  If, now and then, during their\\ntravels, they had fallen slightly out of step, harmony had been\\nrestored by their return to the conditions she was used to.  He had\\nalways foreseen that she would not disappoint him; and he had been\\nright.  He had married (as most young men did) because he had met a\\nperfectly charming girl at the moment when a series of rather aimless\\nsentimental adventures were ending in premature disgust; and she had\\nrepresented peace, stability, comradeship, and the steadying sense of\\nan unescapable duty.\\n\\nHe could not say that he had been mistaken in his choice, for she had\\nfulfilled all that he had expected.  It was undoubtedly gratifying to\\nbe the husband of one of the handsomest and most popular young married\\nwomen in New York, especially when she was also one of the\\nsweetest-tempered and most reasonable of wives; and Archer had never\\nbeen insensible to such advantages.  As for the momentary madness which\\nhad fallen upon him on the eve of his marriage, he had trained himself\\nto regard it as the last of his discarded experiments.  The idea that\\nhe could ever, in his senses, have dreamed of marrying the Countess\\nOlenska had become almost unthinkable, and she remained in his memory\\nsimply as the most plaintive and poignant of a line of ghosts.\\n\\nBut all these abstractions and eliminations made of his mind a rather\\nempty and echoing place, and he supposed that was one of the reasons\\nwhy the busy animated people on the Beaufort lawn shocked him as if\\nthey had been children playing in a grave-yard.\\n\\nHe heard a murmur of skirts beside him, and the Marchioness Manson\\nfluttered out of the drawing-room window.  As usual, she was\\nextraordinarily festooned and bedizened, with a limp Leghorn hat\\nanchored to her head by many windings of faded gauze, and a little\\nblack velvet parasol on a carved ivory handle absurdly balanced over\\nher much larger hatbrim.\\n\\n\"My dear Newland, I had no idea that you and May had arrived!  You\\nyourself came only yesterday, you say?  Ah,\\nbusiness--business--professional duties ... I understand.  Many\\nhusbands, I know, find it impossible to join their wives here except\\nfor the week-end.\"  She cocked her head on one side and languished at\\nhim through screwed-up eyes.  \"But marriage is one long sacrifice, as I\\nused often to remind my Ellen--\"\\n\\nArcher\\'s heart stopped with the queer jerk which it had given once\\nbefore, and which seemed suddenly to slam a door between himself and\\nthe outer world; but this break of continuity must have been of the\\nbriefest, for he presently heard Medora answering a question he had\\napparently found voice to put.\\n\\n\"No, I am not staying here, but with the Blenkers, in their delicious\\nsolitude at Portsmouth.  Beaufort was kind enough to send his famous\\ntrotters for me this morning, so that I might have at least a glimpse\\nof one of Regina\\'s garden-parties; but this evening I go back to rural\\nlife.  The Blenkers, dear original beings, have hired a primitive old\\nfarm-house at Portsmouth where they gather about them representative\\npeople ...\"  She drooped slightly beneath her protecting brim, and\\nadded with a faint blush:  \"This week Dr. Agathon Carver is holding a\\nseries of Inner Thought meetings there.  A contrast indeed to this gay\\nscene of worldly pleasure--but then I have always lived on contrasts!\\nTo me the only death is monotony.  I always say to Ellen: Beware of\\nmonotony; it\\'s the mother of all the deadly sins.  But my poor child is\\ngoing through a phase of exaltation, of abhorrence of the world.  You\\nknow, I suppose, that she has declined all invitations to stay at\\nNewport, even with her grandmother Mingott?  I could hardly persuade\\nher to come with me to the Blenkers\\', if you will believe it!  The life\\nshe leads is morbid, unnatural.  Ah, if she had only listened to me\\nwhen it was still possible ... When the door was still open ... But\\nshall we go down and watch this absorbing match?  I hear your May is\\none of the competitors.\"\\n\\nStrolling toward them from the tent Beaufort advanced over the lawn,\\ntall, heavy, too tightly buttoned into a London frock-coat, with one of\\nhis own orchids in its buttonhole.  Archer, who had not seen him for\\ntwo or three months, was struck by the change in his appearance.  In\\nthe hot summer light his floridness seemed heavy and bloated, and but\\nfor his erect square-shouldered walk he would have looked like an\\nover-fed and over-dressed old man.\\n\\nThere were all sorts of rumours afloat about Beaufort.  In the spring\\nhe had gone off on a long cruise to the West Indies in his new\\nsteam-yacht, and it was reported that, at various points where he had\\ntouched, a lady resembling Miss Fanny Ring had been seen in his\\ncompany.  The steam-yacht, built in the Clyde, and fitted with tiled\\nbath-rooms and other unheard-of luxuries, was said to have cost him\\nhalf a million; and the pearl necklace which he had presented to his\\nwife on his return was as magnificent as such expiatory offerings are\\napt to be.  Beaufort\\'s fortune was substantial enough to stand the\\nstrain; and yet the disquieting rumours persisted, not only in Fifth\\nAvenue but in Wall Street.  Some people said he had speculated\\nunfortunately in railways, others that he was being bled by one of the\\nmost insatiable members of her profession; and to every report of\\nthreatened insolvency Beaufort replied by a fresh extravagance: the\\nbuilding of a new row of orchid-houses, the purchase of a new string of\\nrace-horses, or the addition of a new Meissonnier or Cabanel to his\\npicture-gallery.\\n\\nHe advanced toward the Marchioness and Newland with his usual\\nhalf-sneering smile.  \"Hullo, Medora!  Did the trotters do their\\nbusiness?  Forty minutes, eh?  ...  Well, that\\'s not so bad,\\nconsidering your nerves had to be spared.\"  He shook hands with Archer,\\nand then, turning back with them, placed himself on Mrs. Manson\\'s other\\nside, and said, in a low voice, a few words which their companion did\\nnot catch.\\n\\nThe Marchioness replied by one of her queer foreign jerks, and a \"Que\\nvoulez-vous?\" which deepened Beaufort\\'s frown; but he produced a good\\nsemblance of a congratulatory smile as he glanced at Archer to say:\\n\"You know May\\'s going to carry off the first prize.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, then it remains in the family,\" Medora rippled; and at that moment\\nthey reached the tent and Mrs. Beaufort met them in a girlish cloud of\\nmauve muslin and floating veils.\\n\\nMay Welland was just coming out of the tent.  In her white dress, with\\na pale green ribbon about the waist and a wreath of ivy on her hat, she\\nhad the same Diana-like aloofness as when she had entered the Beaufort\\nball-room on the night of her engagement.  In the interval not a\\nthought seemed to have passed behind her eyes or a feeling through her\\nheart; and though her husband knew that she had the capacity for both\\nhe marvelled afresh at the way in which experience dropped away from\\nher.\\n\\nShe had her bow and arrow in her hand, and placing herself on the\\nchalk-mark traced on the turf she lifted the bow to her shoulder and\\ntook aim.  The attitude was so full of a classic grace that a murmur of\\nappreciation followed her appearance, and Archer felt the glow of\\nproprietorship that so often cheated him into momentary well-being.\\nHer rivals--Mrs. Reggie Chivers, the Merry girls, and divers rosy\\nThorleys, Dagonets and Mingotts, stood behind her in a lovely anxious\\ngroup, brown heads and golden bent above the scores, and pale muslins\\nand flower-wreathed hats mingled in a tender rainbow.  All were young\\nand pretty, and bathed in summer bloom; but not one had the nymph-like\\nease of his wife, when, with tense muscles and happy frown, she bent\\nher soul upon some feat of strength.\\n\\n\"Gad,\" Archer heard Lawrence Lefferts say, \"not one of the lot holds\\nthe bow as she does\"; and Beaufort retorted:  \"Yes; but that\\'s the only\\nkind of target she\\'ll ever hit.\"\\n\\nArcher felt irrationally angry.  His host\\'s contemptuous tribute to\\nMay\\'s \"niceness\" was just what a husband should have wished to hear\\nsaid of his wife.  The fact that a coarseminded man found her lacking\\nin attraction was simply another proof of her quality; yet the words\\nsent a faint shiver through his heart.  What if \"niceness\" carried to\\nthat supreme degree were only a negation, the curtain dropped before an\\nemptiness?  As he looked at May, returning flushed and calm from her\\nfinal bull\\'s-eye, he had the feeling that he had never yet lifted that\\ncurtain.\\n\\nShe took the congratulations of her rivals and of the rest of the\\ncompany with the simplicity that was her crowning grace.  No one could\\never be jealous of her triumphs because she managed to give the feeling\\nthat she would have been just as serene if she had missed them.  But\\nwhen her eyes met her husband\\'s her face glowed with the pleasure she\\nsaw in his.\\n\\nMrs. Welland\\'s basket-work pony-carriage was waiting for them, and they\\ndrove off among the dispersing carriages, May handling the reins and\\nArcher sitting at her side.\\n\\nThe afternoon sunlight still lingered upon the bright lawns and\\nshrubberies, and up and down Bellevue Avenue rolled a double line of\\nvictorias, dog-carts, landaus and \"vis-a-vis,\" carrying well-dressed\\nladies and gentlemen away from the Beaufort garden-party, or homeward\\nfrom their daily afternoon turn along the Ocean Drive.\\n\\n\"Shall we go to see Granny?\" May suddenly proposed.  \"I should like to\\ntell her myself that I\\'ve won the prize.  There\\'s lots of time before\\ndinner.\"\\n\\nArcher acquiesced, and she turned the ponies down Narragansett Avenue,\\ncrossed Spring Street and drove out toward the rocky moorland beyond.\\nIn this unfashionable region Catherine the Great, always indifferent to\\nprecedent and thrifty of purse, had built herself in her youth a\\nmany-peaked and cross-beamed cottage-orne on a bit of cheap land\\noverlooking the bay.  Here, in a thicket of stunted oaks, her verandahs\\nspread themselves above the island-dotted waters.  A winding drive led\\nup between iron stags and blue glass balls embedded in mounds of\\ngeraniums to a front door of highly-varnished walnut under a striped\\nverandah-roof; and behind it ran a narrow hall with a black and yellow\\nstar-patterned parquet floor, upon which opened four small square rooms\\nwith heavy flock-papers under ceilings on which an Italian\\nhouse-painter had lavished all the divinities of Olympus.  One of these\\nrooms had been turned into a bedroom by Mrs. Mingott when the burden of\\nflesh descended on her, and in the adjoining one she spent her days,\\nenthroned in a large armchair between the open door and window, and\\nperpetually waving a palm-leaf fan which the prodigious projection of\\nher bosom kept so far from the rest of her person that the air it set\\nin motion stirred only the fringe of the anti-macassars on the\\nchair-arms.\\n\\nSince she had been the means of hastening his marriage old Catherine\\nhad shown to Archer the cordiality which a service rendered excites\\ntoward the person served.  She was persuaded that irrepressible passion\\nwas the cause of his impatience; and being an ardent admirer of\\nimpulsiveness (when it did not lead to the spending of money) she\\nalways received him with a genial twinkle of complicity and a play of\\nallusion to which May seemed fortunately impervious.\\n\\nShe examined and appraised with much interest the diamond-tipped arrow\\nwhich had been pinned on May\\'s bosom at the conclusion of the match,\\nremarking that in her day a filigree brooch would have been thought\\nenough, but that there was no denying that Beaufort did things\\nhandsomely.\\n\\n\"Quite an heirloom, in fact, my dear,\" the old lady chuckled.  \"You\\nmust leave it in fee to your eldest girl.\" She pinched May\\'s white arm\\nand watched the colour flood her face.  \"Well, well, what have I said\\nto make you shake out the red flag?  Ain\\'t there going to be any\\ndaughters--only boys, eh?  Good gracious, look at her blushing again\\nall over her blushes!  What--can\\'t I say that either?  Mercy me--when\\nmy children beg me to have all those gods and goddesses painted out\\noverhead I always say I\\'m too thankful to have somebody about me that\\nNOTHING can shock!\"\\n\\nArcher burst into a laugh, and May echoed it, crimson to the eyes.\\n\\n\"Well, now tell me all about the party, please, my dears, for I shall\\nnever get a straight word about it out of that silly Medora,\" the\\nancestress continued; and, as May exclaimed:  \"Cousin Medora?  But I\\nthought she was going back to Portsmouth?\" she answered placidly: \"So\\nshe is--but she\\'s got to come here first to pick up Ellen.  Ah--you\\ndidn\\'t know Ellen had come to spend the day with me?  Such fol-de-rol,\\nher not coming for the summer; but I gave up arguing with young people\\nabout fifty years ago.  Ellen--ELLEN!\" she cried in her shrill old\\nvoice, trying to bend forward far enough to catch a glimpse of the lawn\\nbeyond the verandah.\\n\\nThere was no answer, and Mrs. Mingott rapped impatiently with her stick\\non the shiny floor.  A mulatto maid-servant in a bright turban,\\nreplying to the summons, informed her mistress that she had seen \"Miss\\nEllen\" going down the path to the shore; and Mrs. Mingott turned to\\nArcher.\\n\\n\"Run down and fetch her, like a good grandson; this pretty lady will\\ndescribe the party to me,\" she said; and Archer stood up as if in a\\ndream.\\n\\nHe had heard the Countess Olenska\\'s name pronounced often enough during\\nthe year and a half since they had last met, and was even familiar with\\nthe main incidents of her life in the interval.  He knew that she had\\nspent the previous summer at Newport, where she appeared to have gone a\\ngreat deal into society, but that in the autumn she had suddenly\\nsub-let the \"perfect house\" which Beaufort had been at such pains to\\nfind for her, and decided to establish herself in Washington.  There,\\nduring the winter, he had heard of her (as one always heard of pretty\\nwomen in Washington) as shining in the \"brilliant diplomatic society\"\\nthat was supposed to make up for the social short-comings of the\\nAdministration.  He had listened to these accounts, and to various\\ncontradictory reports on her appearance, her conversation, her point of\\nview and her choice of friends, with the detachment with which one\\nlistens to reminiscences of some one long since dead; not till Medora\\nsuddenly spoke her name at the archery match had Ellen Olenska become a\\nliving presence to him again.  The Marchioness\\'s foolish lisp had\\ncalled up a vision of the little fire-lit drawing-room and the sound of\\nthe carriage-wheels returning down the deserted street.  He thought of\\na story he had read, of some peasant children in Tuscany lighting a\\nbunch of straw in a wayside cavern, and revealing old silent images in\\ntheir painted tomb ...\\n\\nThe way to the shore descended from the bank on which the house was\\nperched to a walk above the water planted with weeping willows.\\nThrough their veil Archer caught the glint of the Lime Rock, with its\\nwhite-washed turret and the tiny house in which the heroic light-house\\nkeeper, Ida Lewis, was living her last venerable years.  Beyond it lay\\nthe flat reaches and ugly government chimneys of Goat Island, the bay\\nspreading northward in a shimmer of gold to Prudence Island with its\\nlow growth of oaks, and the shores of Conanicut faint in the sunset\\nhaze.\\n\\nFrom the willow walk projected a slight wooden pier ending in a sort of\\npagoda-like summer-house; and in the pagoda a lady stood, leaning\\nagainst the rail, her back to the shore.  Archer stopped at the sight\\nas if he had waked from sleep.  That vision of the past was a dream,\\nand the reality was what awaited him in the house on the bank overhead:\\nwas Mrs. Welland\\'s pony-carriage circling around and around the oval at\\nthe door, was May sitting under the shameless Olympians and glowing\\nwith secret hopes, was the Welland villa at the far end of Bellevue\\nAvenue, and Mr. Welland, already dressed for dinner, and pacing the\\ndrawing-room floor, watch in hand, with dyspeptic impatience--for it\\nwas one of the houses in which one always knew exactly what is\\nhappening at a given hour.\\n\\n\"What am I?  A son-in-law--\" Archer thought.\\n\\nThe figure at the end of the pier had not moved.  For a long moment the\\nyoung man stood half way down the bank, gazing at the bay furrowed with\\nthe coming and going of sailboats, yacht-launches, fishing-craft and\\nthe trailing black coal-barges hauled by noisy tugs.  The lady in the\\nsummer-house seemed to be held by the same sight.  Beyond the grey\\nbastions of Fort Adams a long-drawn sunset was splintering up into a\\nthousand fires, and the radiance caught the sail of a catboat as it\\nbeat out through the channel between the Lime Rock and the shore.\\nArcher, as he watched, remembered the scene in the Shaughraun, and\\nMontague lifting Ada Dyas\\'s ribbon to his lips without her knowing that\\nhe was in the room.\\n\\n\"She doesn\\'t know--she hasn\\'t guessed.  Shouldn\\'t I know if she came up\\nbehind me, I wonder?\" he mused; and suddenly he said to himself:  \"If\\nshe doesn\\'t turn before that sail crosses the Lime Rock light I\\'ll go\\nback.\"\\n\\nThe boat was gliding out on the receding tide.  It slid before the Lime\\nRock, blotted out Ida Lewis\\'s little house, and passed across the\\nturret in which the light was hung.  Archer waited till a wide space of\\nwater sparkled between the last reef of the island and the stern of the\\nboat; but still the figure in the summer-house did not move.\\n\\nHe turned and walked up the hill.\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry you didn\\'t find Ellen--I should have liked to see her\\nagain,\" May said as they drove home through the dusk.  \"But perhaps she\\nwouldn\\'t have cared--she seems so changed.\"\\n\\n\"Changed?\" echoed her husband in a colourless voice, his eyes fixed on\\nthe ponies\\' twitching ears.\\n\\n\"So indifferent to her friends, I mean; giving up New York and her\\nhouse, and spending her time with such queer people.  Fancy how\\nhideously uncomfortable she must be at the Blenkers\\'!  She says she\\ndoes it to keep cousin Medora out of mischief: to prevent her marrying\\ndreadful people.  But I sometimes think we\\'ve always bored her.\"\\n\\nArcher made no answer, and she continued, with a tinge of hardness that\\nhe had never before noticed in her frank fresh voice:  \"After all, I\\nwonder if she wouldn\\'t be happier with her husband.\"\\n\\nHe burst into a laugh.  \"Sancta simplicitas!\" he exclaimed; and as she\\nturned a puzzled frown on him he added:  \"I don\\'t think I ever heard\\nyou say a cruel thing before.\"\\n\\n\"Cruel?\"\\n\\n\"Well--watching the contortions of the damned is supposed to be a\\nfavourite sport of the angels; but I believe even they don\\'t think\\npeople happier in hell.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a pity she ever married abroad then,\" said May, in the placid\\ntone with which her mother met Mr. Welland\\'s vagaries; and Archer felt\\nhimself gently relegated to the category of unreasonable husbands.\\n\\nThey drove down Bellevue Avenue and turned in between the chamfered\\nwooden gate-posts surmounted by cast-iron lamps which marked the\\napproach to the Welland villa.  Lights were already shining through its\\nwindows, and Archer, as the carriage stopped, caught a glimpse of his\\nfather-in-law, exactly as he had pictured him, pacing the drawing-room,\\nwatch in hand and wearing the pained expression that he had long since\\nfound to be much more efficacious than anger.\\n\\nThe young man, as he followed his wife into the hall, was conscious of\\na curious reversal of mood.  There was something about the luxury of\\nthe Welland house and the density of the Welland atmosphere, so charged\\nwith minute observances and exactions, that always stole into his\\nsystem like a narcotic.  The heavy carpets, the watchful servants, the\\nperpetually reminding tick of disciplined clocks, the perpetually\\nrenewed stack of cards and invitations on the hall table, the whole\\nchain of tyrannical trifles binding one hour to the next, and each\\nmember of the household to all the others, made any less systematised\\nand affluent existence seem unreal and precarious.  But now it was the\\nWelland house, and the life he was expected to lead in it, that had\\nbecome unreal and irrelevant, and the brief scene on the shore, when he\\nhad stood irresolute, halfway down the bank, was as close to him as the\\nblood in his veins.\\n\\nAll night he lay awake in the big chintz bedroom at May\\'s side,\\nwatching the moonlight slant along the carpet, and thinking of Ellen\\nOlenska driving home across the gleaming beaches behind Beaufort\\'s\\ntrotters.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nOnce more on the boat, and in the presence of others, Archer felt a\\ntranquillity of spirit that surprised as much as it sustained him.\\n\\nThe day, according to any current valuation, had been a rather\\nridiculous failure; he had not so much as touched Madame Olenska\\'s hand\\nwith his lips, or extracted one word from her that gave promise of\\nfarther opportunities.  Nevertheless, for a man sick with unsatisfied\\nlove, and parting for an indefinite period from the object of his\\npassion, he felt himself almost humiliatingly calm and comforted.  It\\nwas the perfect balance she had held between their loyalty to others\\nand their honesty to themselves that had so stirred and yet\\ntranquillized him; a balance not artfully calculated, as her tears and\\nher falterings showed, but resulting naturally from her unabashed\\nsincerity.  It filled him with a tender awe, now the danger was over,\\nand made him thank the fates that no personal vanity, no sense of\\nplaying a part before sophisticated witnesses, had tempted him to tempt\\nher.  Even after they had clasped hands for good-bye at the Fall River\\nstation, and he had turned away alone, the conviction remained with him\\nof having saved out of their meeting much more than he had sacrificed.\\n\\nHe wandered back to the club, and went and sat alone in the deserted\\nlibrary, turning and turning over in his thoughts every separate second\\nof their hours together.  It was clear to him, and it grew more clear\\nunder closer scrutiny, that if she should finally decide on returning\\nto Europe--returning to her husband--it would not be because her old\\nlife tempted her, even on the new terms offered.  No: she would go only\\nif she felt herself becoming a temptation to Archer, a temptation to\\nfall away from the standard they had both set up.  Her choice would be\\nto stay near him as long as he did not ask her to come nearer; and it\\ndepended on himself to keep her just there, safe but secluded.\\n\\nIn the train these thoughts were still with him.  They enclosed him in\\na kind of golden haze, through which the faces about him looked remote\\nand indistinct: he had a feeling that if he spoke to his\\nfellow-travellers they would not understand what he was saying.  In\\nthis state of abstraction he found himself, the following morning,\\nwaking to the reality of a stifling September day in New York.  The\\nheat-withered faces in the long train streamed past him, and he\\ncontinued to stare at them through the same golden blur; but suddenly,\\nas he left the station, one of the faces detached itself, came closer\\nand forced itself upon his consciousness.  It was, as he instantly\\nrecalled, the face of the young man he had seen, the day before,\\npassing out of the Parker House, and had noted as not conforming to\\ntype, as not having an American hotel face.\\n\\nThe same thing struck him now; and again he became aware of a dim stir\\nof former associations.  The young man stood looking about him with the\\ndazed air of the foreigner flung upon the harsh mercies of American\\ntravel; then he advanced toward Archer, lifted his hat, and said in\\nEnglish:  \"Surely, Monsieur, we met in London?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, to be sure: in London!\"  Archer grasped his hand with curiosity\\nand sympathy.  \"So you DID get here, after all?\" he exclaimed, casting\\na wondering eye on the astute and haggard little countenance of young\\nCarfry\\'s French tutor.\\n\\n\"Oh, I got here--yes,\" M. Riviere smiled with drawn lips.  \"But not for\\nlong; I return the day after tomorrow.\" He stood grasping his light\\nvalise in one neatly gloved hand, and gazing anxiously, perplexedly,\\nalmost appealingly, into Archer\\'s face.\\n\\n\"I wonder, Monsieur, since I\\'ve had the good luck to run across you, if\\nI might--\"\\n\\n\"I was just going to suggest it: come to luncheon, won\\'t you?  Down\\ntown, I mean: if you\\'ll look me up in my office I\\'ll take you to a very\\ndecent restaurant in that quarter.\"\\n\\n\\nM. Riviere was visibly touched and surprised.  \"You\\'re too kind.  But I\\nwas only going to ask if you would tell me how to reach some sort of\\nconveyance.  There are no porters, and no one here seems to listen--\"\\n\\n\"I know: our American stations must surprise you.  When you ask for a\\nporter they give you chewing-gum.  But if you\\'ll come along I\\'ll\\nextricate you; and you must really lunch with me, you know.\"\\n\\nThe young man, after a just perceptible hesitation, replied, with\\nprofuse thanks, and in a tone that did not carry complete conviction,\\nthat he was already engaged; but when they had reached the comparative\\nreassurance of the street he asked if he might call that afternoon.\\n\\nArcher, at ease in the midsummer leisure of the office, fixed an hour\\nand scribbled his address, which the Frenchman pocketed with reiterated\\nthanks and a wide flourish of his hat.  A horse-car received him, and\\nArcher walked away.\\n\\nPunctually at the hour M. Riviere appeared, shaved, smoothed-out, but\\nstill unmistakably drawn and serious.  Archer was alone in his office,\\nand the young man, before accepting the seat he proffered, began\\nabruptly: \"I believe I saw you, sir, yesterday in Boston.\"\\n\\nThe statement was insignificant enough, and Archer was about to frame\\nan assent when his words were checked by something mysterious yet\\nilluminating in his visitor\\'s insistent gaze.\\n\\n\"It is extraordinary, very extraordinary,\" M. Riviere continued, \"that\\nwe should have met in the circumstances in which I find myself.\"\\n\\n\"What circumstances?\" Archer asked, wondering a little crudely if he\\nneeded money.\\n\\nM. Riviere continued to study him with tentative eyes.  \"I have come,\\nnot to look for employment, as I spoke of doing when we last met, but\\non a special mission--\"\\n\\n\"Ah--!\" Archer exclaimed.  In a flash the two meetings had connected\\nthemselves in his mind.  He paused to take in the situation thus\\nsuddenly lighted up for him, and M. Riviere also remained silent, as if\\naware that what he had said was enough.\\n\\n\"A special mission,\" Archer at length repeated.\\n\\nThe young Frenchman, opening his palms, raised them slightly, and the\\ntwo men continued to look at each other across the office-desk till\\nArcher roused himself to say:  \"Do sit down\"; whereupon M. Riviere\\nbowed, took a distant chair, and again waited.\\n\\n\"It was about this mission that you wanted to consult me?\" Archer\\nfinally asked.\\n\\nM. Riviere bent his head.  \"Not in my own behalf: on that score I--I\\nhave fully dealt with myself.  I should like--if I may--to speak to you\\nabout the Countess Olenska.\"\\n\\nArcher had known for the last few minutes that the words were coming;\\nbut when they came they sent the blood rushing to his temples as if he\\nhad been caught by a bent-back branch in a thicket.\\n\\n\"And on whose behalf,\" he said, \"do you wish to do this?\"\\n\\nM. Riviere met the question sturdily.  \"Well--I might say HERS, if it\\ndid not sound like a liberty.  Shall I say instead: on behalf of\\nabstract justice?\"\\n\\nArcher considered him ironically.  \"In other words: you are Count\\nOlenski\\'s messenger?\"\\n\\nHe saw his blush more darkly reflected in M. Riviere\\'s sallow\\ncountenance.  \"Not to YOU, Monsieur.  If I come to you, it is on quite\\nother grounds.\"\\n\\n\"What right have you, in the circumstances, to BE on any other ground?\"\\nArcher retorted.  \"If you\\'re an emissary you\\'re an emissary.\"\\n\\nThe young man considered.  \"My mission is over: as far as the Countess\\nOlenska goes, it has failed.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t help that,\" Archer rejoined on the same note of irony.\\n\\n\"No: but you can help--\"  M. Riviere paused, turned his hat about in\\nhis still carefully gloved hands, looked into its lining and then back\\nat Archer\\'s face.  \"You can help, Monsieur, I am convinced, to make it\\nequally a failure with her family.\"\\n\\nArcher pushed back his chair and stood up.  \"Well--and by God I will!\"\\nhe exclaimed.  He stood with his hands in his pockets, staring down\\nwrathfully at the little Frenchman, whose face, though he too had\\nrisen, was still an inch or two below the line of Archer\\'s eyes.\\n\\nM. Riviere paled to his normal hue: paler than that his complexion\\ncould hardly turn.\\n\\n\"Why the devil,\" Archer explosively continued, \"should you have\\nthought--since I suppose you\\'re appealing to me on the ground of my\\nrelationship to Madame Olenska--that I should take a view contrary to\\nthe rest of her family?\"\\n\\nThe change of expression in M. Riviere\\'s face was for a time his only\\nanswer.  His look passed from timidity to absolute distress: for a\\nyoung man of his usually resourceful mien it would have been difficult\\nto appear more disarmed and defenceless.  \"Oh, Monsieur--\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t imagine,\" Archer continued, \"why you should have come to me\\nwhen there are others so much nearer to the Countess; still less why\\nyou thought I should be more accessible to the arguments I suppose you\\nwere sent over with.\"\\n\\n\\nM. Riviere took this onslaught with a disconcerting humility.  \"The\\narguments I want to present to you, Monsieur, are my own and not those\\nI was sent over with.\"\\n\\n\"Then I see still less reason for listening to them.\"\\n\\nM. Riviere again looked into his hat, as if considering whether these\\nlast words were not a sufficiently broad hint to put it on and be gone.\\nThen he spoke with sudden decision.  \"Monsieur--will you tell me one\\nthing?  Is it my right to be here that you question?  Or do you perhaps\\nbelieve the whole matter to be already closed?\"\\n\\nHis quiet insistence made Archer feel the clumsiness of his own\\nbluster.  M. Riviere had succeeded in imposing himself:  Archer,\\nreddening slightly, dropped into his chair again, and signed to the\\nyoung man to be seated.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon: but why isn\\'t the matter closed?\"\\n\\n\\nM. Riviere gazed back at him with anguish.  \"You do, then, agree with\\nthe rest of the family that, in face of the new proposals I have\\nbrought, it is hardly possible for Madame Olenska not to return to her\\nhusband?\"\\n\\n\"Good God!\" Archer exclaimed; and his visitor gave out a low murmur of\\nconfirmation.\\n\\n\"Before seeing her, I saw--at Count Olenski\\'s request--Mr. Lovell\\nMingott, with whom I had several talks before going to Boston.  I\\nunderstand that he represents his mother\\'s view; and that Mrs. Manson\\nMingott\\'s influence is great throughout her family.\"\\n\\nArcher sat silent, with the sense of clinging to the edge of a sliding\\nprecipice.  The discovery that he had been excluded from a share in\\nthese negotiations, and even from the knowledge that they were on foot,\\ncaused him a surprise hardly dulled by the acuter wonder of what he was\\nlearning.  He saw in a flash that if the family had ceased to consult\\nhim it was because some deep tribal instinct warned them that he was no\\nlonger on their side; and he recalled, with a start of comprehension, a\\nremark of May\\'s during their drive home from Mrs. Manson Mingott\\'s on\\nthe day of the Archery Meeting:  \"Perhaps, after all, Ellen would be\\nhappier with her husband.\"\\n\\nEven in the tumult of new discoveries Archer remembered his indignant\\nexclamation, and the fact that since then his wife had never named\\nMadame Olenska to him.  Her careless allusion had no doubt been the\\nstraw held up to see which way the wind blew; the result had been\\nreported to the family, and thereafter Archer had been tacitly omitted\\nfrom their counsels.  He admired the tribal discipline which made May\\nbow to this decision.  She would not have done so, he knew, had her\\nconscience protested; but she probably shared the family view that\\nMadame Olenska would be better off as an unhappy wife than as a\\nseparated one, and that there was no use in discussing the case with\\nNewland, who had an awkward way of suddenly not seeming to take the\\nmost fundamental things for granted.\\n\\nArcher looked up and met his visitor\\'s anxious gaze.  \"Don\\'t you know,\\nMonsieur--is it possible you don\\'t know--that the family begin to doubt\\nif they have the right to advise the Countess to refuse her husband\\'s\\nlast proposals?\"\\n\\n\"The proposals you brought?\"\\n\\n\"The proposals I brought.\"\\n\\nIt was on Archer\\'s lips to exclaim that whatever he knew or did not\\nknow was no concern of M. Riviere\\'s; but something in the humble and\\nyet courageous tenacity of M. Riviere\\'s gaze made him reject this\\nconclusion, and he met the young man\\'s question with another.  \"What is\\nyour object in speaking to me of this?\"\\n\\nHe had not to wait a moment for the answer.  \"To beg you, Monsieur--to\\nbeg you with all the force I\\'m capable of--not to let her go back.--Oh,\\ndon\\'t let her!\" M. Riviere exclaimed.\\n\\nArcher looked at him with increasing astonishment.  There was no\\nmistaking the sincerity of his distress or the strength of his\\ndetermination: he had evidently resolved to let everything go by the\\nboard but the supreme need of thus putting himself on record.  Archer\\nconsidered.\\n\\n\"May I ask,\" he said at length, \"if this is the line you took with the\\nCountess Olenska?\"\\n\\n\\nM. Riviere reddened, but his eyes did not falter.  \"No, Monsieur: I\\naccepted my mission in good faith.  I really believed--for reasons I\\nneed not trouble you with--that it would be better for Madame Olenska\\nto recover her situation, her fortune, the social consideration that\\nher husband\\'s standing gives her.\"\\n\\n\"So I supposed: you could hardly have accepted such a mission\\notherwise.\"\\n\\n\"I should not have accepted it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then--?\"  Archer paused again, and their eyes met in another\\nprotracted scrutiny.\\n\\n\"Ah, Monsieur, after I had seen her, after I had listened to her, I\\nknew she was better off here.\"\\n\\n\"You knew--?\"\\n\\n\"Monsieur, I discharged my mission faithfully: I put the Count\\'s\\narguments, I stated his offers, without adding any comment of my own.\\nThe Countess was good enough to listen patiently; she carried her\\ngoodness so far as to see me twice; she considered impartially all I\\nhad come to say.  And it was in the course of these two talks that I\\nchanged my mind, that I came to see things differently.\"\\n\\n\"May I ask what led to this change?\"\\n\\n\"Simply seeing the change in HER,\" M. Riviere replied.\\n\\n\"The change in her?  Then you knew her before?\"\\n\\nThe young man\\'s colour again rose.  \"I used to see her in her husband\\'s\\nhouse.  I have known Count Olenski for many years.  You can imagine\\nthat he would not have sent a stranger on such a mission.\"\\n\\nArcher\\'s gaze, wandering away to the blank walls of the office, rested\\non a hanging calendar surmounted by the rugged features of the\\nPresident of the United States.  That such a conversation should be\\ngoing on anywhere within the millions of square miles subject to his\\nrule seemed as strange as anything that the imagination could invent.\\n\\n\"The change--what sort of a change?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, Monsieur, if I could tell you!\"  M. Riviere paused.  \"Tenez--the\\ndiscovery, I suppose, of what I\\'d never thought of before: that she\\'s\\nan American.  And that if you\\'re an American of HER kind--of your\\nkind--things that are accepted in certain other societies, or at least\\nput up with as part of a general convenient give-and-take--become\\nunthinkable, simply unthinkable.  If Madame Olenska\\'s relations\\nunderstood what these things were, their opposition to her returning\\nwould no doubt be as unconditional as her own; but they seem to regard\\nher husband\\'s wish to have her back as proof of an irresistible longing\\nfor domestic life.\"  M. Riviere paused, and then added:  \"Whereas it\\'s\\nfar from being as simple as that.\"\\n\\nArcher looked back to the President of the United States, and then down\\nat his desk and at the papers scattered on it.  For a second or two he\\ncould not trust himself to speak.  During this interval he heard M.\\nRiviere\\'s chair pushed back, and was aware that the young man had\\nrisen.  When he glanced up again he saw that his visitor was as moved\\nas himself.\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" Archer said simply.\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing to thank me for, Monsieur: it is I, rather--\"  M.\\nRiviere broke off, as if speech for him too were difficult.  \"I should\\nlike, though,\" he continued in a firmer voice, \"to add one thing.  You\\nasked me if I was in Count Olenski\\'s employ.  I am at this moment: I\\nreturned to him, a few months ago, for reasons of private necessity\\nsuch as may happen to any one who has persons, ill and older persons,\\ndependent on him.  But from the moment that I have taken the step of\\ncoming here to say these things to you I consider myself discharged,\\nand I shall tell him so on my return, and give him the reasons.  That\\'s\\nall, Monsieur.\"\\n\\nM. Riviere bowed and drew back a step.\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" Archer said again, as their hands met.',\n",

All the old\\nladies in both families had got out their faded sables and yellowing\\nermines, and the smell of camphor from the front pews almost smothered\\nthe faint spring scent of the lilies banking the altar.\\n\\nNewland Archer, at a signal from the sexton, had come out of the vestry\\nand placed himself with his best man on the chancel step of Grace\\nChurch.\\n\\nThe signal meant that the brougham bearing the bride and her father was\\nin sight; but there was sure to be a considerable interval of\\nadjustment and consultation in the lobby, where the bridesmaids were\\nalready hovering like a cluster of Easter blossoms.  During this\\nunavoidable lapse of time the bridegroom, in proof of his eagerness,\\nwas expected to expose himself alone to the gaze of the assembled\\ncompany; and Archer had gone through this formality as resignedly as\\nthrough all the others which made of a nineteenth century New York\\nwedding a rite that seemed to belong to the dawn of history.\\nEverything was equally easy--or equally painful, as one chose to put\\nit--in the path he was committed to tread, and he had obeyed the\\nflurried injunctions of his best man as piously as other bridegrooms\\nhad obeyed his own, in the days when he had guided them through the\\nsame labyrinth.\\n\\nSo far he was reasonably sure of having fulfilled all his obligations.\\nThe bridesmaids\\' eight bouquets of white lilac and lilies-of-the-valley\\nhad been sent in due time, as well as the gold and sapphire\\nsleeve-links of the eight ushers and the best man\\'s cat\\'s-eye\\nscarf-pin; Archer had sat up half the night trying to vary the wording\\nof his thanks for the last batch of presents from men friends and\\nex-lady-loves; the fees for the Bishop and the Rector were safely in\\nthe pocket of his best man; his own luggage was already at Mrs. Manson\\nMingott\\'s, where the wedding-breakfast was to take place, and so were\\nthe travelling clothes into which he was to change; and a private\\ncompartment had been engaged in the train that was to carry the young\\ncouple to their unknown destination--concealment of the spot in which\\nthe bridal night was to be spent being one of the most sacred taboos of\\nthe prehistoric ritual.\\n\\n\"Got the ring all right?\" whispered young van der Luyden Newland, who\\nwas inexperienced in the duties of a best man, and awed by the weight\\nof his responsibility.\\n\\nArcher made the gesture which he had seen so many bridegrooms make:\\nwith his ungloved right hand he felt in the pocket of his dark grey\\nwaistcoat, and assured himself that the little gold circlet (engraved\\ninside: Newland to May, April ---, 187-) was in its place; then,\\nresuming his former attitude, his tall hat and pearl-grey gloves with\\nblack stitchings grasped in his left hand, he stood looking at the door\\nof the church.\\n\\nOverhead, Handel\\'s March swelled pompously through the imitation stone\\nvaulting, carrying on its waves the faded drift of the many weddings at\\nwhich, with cheerful indifference, he had stood on the same chancel\\nstep watching other brides float up the nave toward other bridegrooms.\\n\\n\"How like a first night at the Opera!\" he thought, recognising all the\\nsame faces in the same boxes (no, pews), and wondering if, when the\\nLast Trump sounded, Mrs. Selfridge Merry would be there with the same\\ntowering ostrich feathers in her bonnet, and Mrs. Beaufort with the\\nsame diamond earrings and the same smile--and whether suitable\\nproscenium seats were already prepared for them in another world.\\n\\nAfter that there was still time to review, one by one, the familiar\\ncountenances in the first rows; the women\\'s sharp with curiosity and\\nexcitement, the men\\'s sulky with the obligation of having to put on\\ntheir frock-coats before luncheon, and fight for food at the\\nwedding-breakfast.\\n\\n\"Too bad the breakfast is at old Catherine\\'s,\" the bridegroom could\\nfancy Reggie Chivers saying.  \"But I\\'m told that Lovell Mingott\\ninsisted on its being cooked by his own chef, so it ought to be good if\\none can only get at it.\"  And he could imagine Sillerton Jackson adding\\nwith authority:  \"My dear fellow, haven\\'t you heard?  It\\'s to be served\\nat small tables, in the new English fashion.\"\\n\\nArcher\\'s eyes lingered a moment on the left-hand pew, where his mother,\\nwho had entered the church on Mr. Henry van der Luyden\\'s arm, sat\\nweeping softly under her Chantilly veil, her hands in her grandmother\\'s\\nermine muff.\\n\\n\"Poor Janey!\" he thought, looking at his sister, \"even by screwing her\\nhead around she can see only the people in the few front pews; and\\nthey\\'re mostly dowdy Newlands and Dagonets.\"\\n\\nOn the hither side of the white ribbon dividing off the seats reserved\\nfor the families he saw Beaufort, tall and redfaced, scrutinising the\\nwomen with his arrogant stare.  Beside him sat his wife, all silvery\\nchinchilla and violets; and on the far side of the ribbon, Lawrence\\nLefferts\\'s sleekly brushed head seemed to mount guard over the\\ninvisible deity of \"Good Form\" who presided at the ceremony.\\n\\nArcher wondered how many flaws Lefferts\\'s keen eyes would discover in\\nthe ritual of his divinity; then he suddenly recalled that he too had\\nonce thought such questions important.  The things that had filled his\\ndays seemed now like a nursery parody of life, or like the wrangles of\\nmediaeval schoolmen over metaphysical terms that nobody had ever\\nunderstood.  A stormy discussion as to whether the wedding presents\\nshould be \"shown\" had darkened the last hours before the wedding; and\\nit seemed inconceivable to Archer that grown-up people should work\\nthemselves into a state of agitation over such trifles, and that the\\nmatter should have been decided (in the negative) by Mrs. Welland\\'s\\nsaying, with indignant tears:  \"I should as soon turn the reporters\\nloose in my house.\"  Yet there was a time when Archer had had definite\\nand rather aggressive opinions on all such problems, and when\\neverything concerning the manners and customs of his little tribe had\\nseemed to him fraught with world-wide significance.\\n\\n\"And all the while, I suppose,\" he thought, \"real people were living\\nsomewhere, and real things happening to them ...\"\\n\\n\"THERE THEY COME!\" breathed the best man excitedly; but the bridegroom\\nknew better.\\n\\nThe cautious opening of the door of the church meant only that Mr.\\nBrown the livery-stable keeper (gowned in black in his intermittent\\ncharacter of sexton) was taking a preliminary survey of the scene\\nbefore marshalling his forces.  The door was softly shut again; then\\nafter another interval it swung majestically open, and a murmur ran\\nthrough the church:  \"The family!\"\\n\\nMrs. Welland came first, on the arm of her eldest son.  Her large pink\\nface was appropriately solemn, and her plum-coloured satin with pale\\nblue side-panels, and blue ostrich plumes in a small satin bonnet, met\\nwith general approval; but before she had settled herself with a\\nstately rustle in the pew opposite Mrs. Archer\\'s the spectators were\\ncraning their necks to see who was coming after her.  Wild rumours had\\nbeen abroad the day before to the effect that Mrs. Manson Mingott, in\\nspite of her physical disabilities, had resolved on being present at\\nthe ceremony; and the idea was so much in keeping with her sporting\\ncharacter that bets ran high at the clubs as to her being able to walk\\nup the nave and squeeze into a seat.  It was known that she had\\ninsisted on sending her own carpenter to look into the possibility of\\ntaking down the end panel of the front pew, and to measure the space\\nbetween the seat and the front; but the result had been discouraging,\\nand for one anxious day her family had watched her dallying with the\\nplan of being wheeled up the nave in her enormous Bath chair and\\nsitting enthroned in it at the foot of the chancel.\\n\\nThe idea of this monstrous exposure of her person was so painful to her\\nrelations that they could have covered with gold the ingenious person\\nwho suddenly discovered that the chair was too wide to pass between the\\niron uprights of the awning which extended from the church door to the\\ncurbstone.  The idea of doing away with this awning, and revealing the\\nbride to the mob of dressmakers and newspaper reporters who stood\\noutside fighting to get near the joints of the canvas, exceeded even\\nold Catherine\\'s courage, though for a moment she had weighed the\\npossibility.  \"Why, they might take a photograph of my child AND PUT IT\\nIN THE PAPERS!\" Mrs. Welland exclaimed when her mother\\'s last plan was\\nhinted to her; and from this unthinkable indecency the clan recoiled\\nwith a collective shudder.  The ancestress had had to give in; but her\\nconcession was bought only by the promise that the wedding-breakfast\\nshould take place under her roof, though (as the Washington Square\\nconnection said) with the Wellands\\' house in easy reach it was hard to\\nhave to make a special price with Brown to drive one to the other end\\nof nowhere.\\n\\nThough all these transactions had been widely reported by the Jacksons\\na sporting minority still clung to the belief that old Catherine would\\nappear in church, and there was a distinct lowering of the temperature\\nwhen she was found to have been replaced by her daughter-in-law.  Mrs.\\nLovell Mingott had the high colour and glassy stare induced in ladies\\nof her age and habit by the effort of getting into a new dress; but\\nonce the disappointment occasioned by her mother-in-law\\'s\\nnon-appearance had subsided, it was agreed that her black Chantilly\\nover lilac satin, with a bonnet of Parma violets, formed the happiest\\ncontrast to Mrs. Welland\\'s blue and plum-colour.  Far different was the\\nimpression produced by the gaunt and mincing lady who followed on Mr.\\nMingott\\'s arm, in a wild dishevelment of stripes and fringes and\\nfloating scarves; and as this last apparition glided into view Archer\\'s\\nheart contracted and stopped beating.\\n\\nHe had taken it for granted that the Marchioness Manson was still in\\nWashington, where she had gone some four weeks previously with her\\nniece, Madame Olenska.  It was generally understood that their abrupt\\ndeparture was due to Madame Olenska\\'s desire to remove her aunt from\\nthe baleful eloquence of Dr. Agathon Carver, who had nearly succeeded\\nin enlisting her as a recruit for the Valley of Love; and in the\\ncircumstances no one had expected either of the ladies to return for\\nthe wedding.  For a moment Archer stood with his eyes fixed on Medora\\'s\\nfantastic figure, straining to see who came behind her; but the little\\nprocession was at an end, for all the lesser members of the family had\\ntaken their seats, and the eight tall ushers, gathering themselves\\ntogether like birds or insects preparing for some migratory manoeuvre,\\nwere already slipping through the side doors into the lobby.\\n\\n\"Newland--I say: SHE\\'S HERE!\" the best man whispered.\\n\\nArcher roused himself with a start.\\n\\nA long time had apparently passed since his heart had stopped beating,\\nfor the white and rosy procession was in fact half way up the nave, the\\nBishop, the Rector and two white-winged assistants were hovering about\\nthe flower-banked altar, and the first chords of the Spohr symphony\\nwere strewing their flower-like notes before the bride.\\n\\nArcher opened his eyes (but could they really have been shut, as he\\nimagined?), and felt his heart beginning to resume its usual task.  The\\nmusic, the scent of the lilies on the altar, the vision of the cloud of\\ntulle and orange-blossoms floating nearer and nearer, the sight of Mrs.\\nArcher\\'s face suddenly convulsed with happy sobs, the low benedictory\\nmurmur of the Rector\\'s voice, the ordered evolutions of the eight pink\\nbridesmaids and the eight black ushers: all these sights, sounds and\\nsensations, so familiar in themselves, so unutterably strange and\\nmeaningless in his new relation to them, were confusedly mingled in his\\nbrain.\\n\\n\"My God,\" he thought, \"HAVE I got the ring?\"--and once more he went\\nthrough the bridegroom\\'s convulsive gesture.\\n\\nThen, in a moment, May was beside him, such radiance streaming from her\\nthat it sent a faint warmth through his numbness, and he straightened\\nhimself and smiled into her eyes.\\n\\n\"Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here,\" the Rector began ...\\n\\nThe ring was on her hand, the Bishop\\'s benediction had been given, the\\nbridesmaids were a-poise to resume their place in the procession, and\\nthe organ was showing preliminary symptoms of breaking out into the\\nMendelssohn March, without which no newly-wedded couple had ever\\nemerged upon New York.\\n\\n\"Your arm--I SAY, GIVE HER YOUR ARM!\" young Newland nervously hissed;\\nand once more Archer became aware of having been adrift far off in the\\nunknown.  What was it that had sent him there, he wondered?  Perhaps\\nthe glimpse, among the anonymous spectators in the transept, of a dark\\ncoil of hair under a hat which, a moment later, revealed itself as\\nbelonging to an unknown lady with a long nose, so laughably unlike the\\nperson whose image she had evoked that he asked himself if he were\\nbecoming subject to hallucinations.\\n\\nAnd now he and his wife were pacing slowly down the nave, carried\\nforward on the light Mendelssohn ripples, the spring day beckoning to\\nthem through widely opened doors, and Mrs. Welland\\'s chestnuts, with\\nbig white favours on their frontlets, curvetting and showing off at the\\nfar end of the canvas tunnel.\\n\\nThe footman, who had a still bigger white favour on his lapel, wrapped\\nMay\\'s white cloak about her, and Archer jumped into the brougham at her\\nside.  She turned to him with a triumphant smile and their hands\\nclasped under her veil.\\n\\n\"Darling!\" Archer said--and suddenly the same black abyss yawned before\\nhim and he felt himself sinking into it, deeper and deeper, while his\\nvoice rambled on smoothly and cheerfully:  \"Yes, of course I thought\\nI\\'d lost the ring; no wedding would be complete if the poor devil of a\\nbridegroom didn\\'t go through that.  But you DID keep me waiting, you\\nknow!  I had time to think of every horror that might possibly happen.\"\\n\\nShe surprised him by turning, in full Fifth Avenue, and flinging her\\narms about his neck.  \"But none ever CAN happen now, can it, Newland,\\nas long as we two are together?\"\\n\\n\\nEvery detail of the day had been so carefully thought out that the\\nyoung couple, after the wedding-breakfast, had ample time to put on\\ntheir travelling-clothes, descend the wide Mingott stairs between\\nlaughing bridesmaids and weeping parents, and get into the brougham\\nunder the traditional shower of rice and satin slippers; and there was\\nstill half an hour left in which to drive to the station, buy the last\\nweeklies at the bookstall with the air of seasoned travellers, and\\nsettle themselves in the reserved compartment in which May\\'s maid had\\nalready placed her dove-coloured travelling cloak and glaringly new\\ndressing-bag from London.\\n\\nThe old du Lac aunts at Rhinebeck had put their house at the disposal\\nof the bridal couple, with a readiness inspired by the prospect of\\nspending a week in New York with Mrs. Archer; and Archer, glad to\\nescape the usual \"bridal suite\" in a Philadelphia or Baltimore hotel,\\nhad accepted with an equal alacrity.\\n\\nMay was enchanted at the idea of going to the country, and childishly\\namused at the vain efforts of the eight bridesmaids to discover where\\ntheir mysterious retreat was situated.  It was thought \"very English\"\\nto have a country-house lent to one, and the fact gave a last touch of\\ndistinction to what was generally conceded to be the most brilliant\\nwedding of the year; but where the house was no one was permitted to\\nknow, except the parents of bride and groom, who, when taxed with the\\nknowledge, pursed their lips and said mysteriously:  \"Ah, they didn\\'t\\ntell us--\" which was manifestly true, since there was no need to.\\n\\nOnce they were settled in their compartment, and the train, shaking off\\nthe endless wooden suburbs, had pushed out into the pale landscape of\\nspring, talk became easier than Archer had expected.  May was still, in\\nlook and tone, the simple girl of yesterday, eager to compare notes\\nwith him as to the incidents of the wedding, and discussing them as\\nimpartially as a bridesmaid talking it all over with an usher.  At\\nfirst Archer had fancied that this detachment was the disguise of an\\ninward tremor; but her clear eyes revealed only the most tranquil\\nunawareness.  She was alone for the first time with her husband; but\\nher husband was only the charming comrade of yesterday.  There was no\\none whom she liked as much, no one whom she trusted as completely, and\\nthe culminating \"lark\" of the whole delightful adventure of engagement\\nand marriage was to be off with him alone on a journey, like a grownup\\nperson, like a \"married woman,\" in fact.\\n\\nIt was wonderful that--as he had learned in the Mission garden at St.\\nAugustine--such depths of feeling could coexist with such absence of\\nimagination.  But he remembered how, even then, she had surprised him\\nby dropping back to inexpressive girlishness as soon as her conscience\\nhad been eased of its burden; and he saw that she would probably go\\nthrough life dealing to the best of her ability with each experience as\\nit came, but never anticipating any by so much as a stolen glance.\\n\\nPerhaps that faculty of unawareness was what gave her eyes their\\ntransparency, and her face the look of representing a type rather than\\na person; as if she might have been chosen to pose for a Civic Virtue\\nor a Greek goddess.  The blood that ran so close to her fair skin might\\nhave been a preserving fluid rather than a ravaging element; yet her\\nlook of indestructible youthfulness made her seem neither hard nor\\ndull, but only primitive and pure.  In the thick of this meditation\\nArcher suddenly felt himself looking at her with the startled gaze of a\\nstranger, and plunged into a reminiscence of the wedding-breakfast and\\nof Granny Mingott\\'s immense and triumphant pervasion of it.\\n\\nMay settled down to frank enjoyment of the subject.  \"I was surprised,\\nthough--weren\\'t you?--that aunt Medora came after all.  Ellen wrote\\nthat they were neither of them well enough to take the journey; I do\\nwish it had been she who had recovered!  Did you see the exquisite old\\nlace she sent me?\"\\n\\nHe had known that the moment must come sooner or later, but he had\\nsomewhat imagined that by force of willing he might hold it at bay.\\n\\n\"Yes--I--no: yes, it was beautiful,\" he said, looking at her blindly,\\nand wondering if, whenever he heard those two syllables, all his\\ncarefully built-up world would tumble about him like a house of cards.\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you tired?  It will be good to have some tea when we\\narrive--I\\'m sure the aunts have got everything beautifully ready,\" he\\nrattled on, taking her hand in his; and her mind rushed away instantly\\nto the magnificent tea and coffee service of Baltimore silver which the\\nBeauforts had sent, and which \"went\" so perfectly with uncle Lovell\\nMingott\\'s trays and side-dishes.\\n\\nIn the spring twilight the train stopped at the Rhinebeck station, and\\nthey walked along the platform to the waiting carriage.\\n\\n\"Ah, how awfully kind of the van der Luydens--they\\'ve sent their man\\nover from Skuytercliff to meet us,\" Archer exclaimed, as a sedate\\nperson out of livery approached them and relieved the maid of her bags.\\n\\n\"I\\'m extremely sorry, sir,\" said this emissary, \"that a little accident\\nhas occurred at the Miss du Lacs\\': a leak in the water-tank.  It\\nhappened yesterday, and Mr. van der Luyden, who heard of it this\\nmorning, sent a housemaid up by the early train to get the Patroon\\'s\\nhouse ready.  It will be quite comfortable, I think you\\'ll find, sir;\\nand the Miss du Lacs have sent their cook over, so that it will be\\nexactly the same as if you\\'d been at Rhinebeck.\"\\n\\nArcher stared at the speaker so blankly that he repeated in still more\\napologetic accents:  \"It\\'ll be exactly the same, sir, I do assure\\nyou--\" and May\\'s eager voice broke out, covering the embarrassed\\nsilence:  \"The same as Rhinebeck?  The Patroon\\'s house?  But it will be\\na hundred thousand times better--won\\'t it, Newland?  It\\'s too dear and\\nkind of Mr. van der Luyden to have thought of it.\"\\n\\nAnd as they drove off, with the maid beside the coachman, and their\\nshining bridal bags on the seat before them, she went on excitedly:\\n\"Only fancy, I\\'ve never been inside it--have you?  The van der Luydens\\nshow it to so few people.  But they opened it for Ellen, it seems, and\\nshe told me what a darling little place it was: she says it\\'s the only\\nhouse she\\'s seen in America that she could imagine being perfectly\\nhappy in.\"\\n\\n\"Well--that\\'s what we\\'re going to be, isn\\'t it?\" cried her husband\\ngaily; and she answered with her boyish smile:  \"Ah, it\\'s just our luck\\nbeginning--the wonderful luck we\\'re always going to have together!\"\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\n\"What are you two plotting together, aunt Medora?\" Madame Olenska cried\\nas she came into the room.\\n\\nShe was dressed as if for a ball.  Everything about her shimmered and\\nglimmered softly, as if her dress had been woven out of candle-beams;\\nand she carried her head high, like a pretty woman challenging a\\nroomful of rivals.\\n\\n\"We were saying, my dear, that here was something beautiful to surprise\\nyou with,\" Mrs. Manson rejoined, rising to her feet and pointing archly\\nto the flowers.\\n\\nMadame Olenska stopped short and looked at the bouquet.  Her colour did\\nnot change, but a sort of white radiance of anger ran over her like\\nsummer lightning.  \"Ah,\" she exclaimed, in a shrill voice that the\\nyoung man had never heard, \"who is ridiculous enough to send me a\\nbouquet?  Why a bouquet?  And why tonight of all nights?  I am not\\ngoing to a ball; I am not a girl engaged to be married.  But some\\npeople are always ridiculous.\"\\n\\nShe turned back to the door, opened it, and called out:  \"Nastasia!\"\\n\\nThe ubiquitous handmaiden promptly appeared, and Archer heard Madame\\nOlenska say, in an Italian that she seemed to pronounce with\\nintentional deliberateness in order that he might follow it:\\n\"Here--throw this into the dustbin!\" and then, as Nastasia stared\\nprotestingly:  \"But no--it\\'s not the fault of the poor flowers.  Tell\\nthe boy to carry them to the house three doors away, the house of Mr.\\nWinsett, the dark gentleman who dined here.  His wife is ill--they may\\ngive her pleasure ... The boy is out, you say?  Then, my dear one, run\\nyourself; here, put my cloak over you and fly.  I want the thing out of\\nthe house immediately!  And, as you live, don\\'t say they come from me!\"\\n\\nShe flung her velvet opera cloak over the maid\\'s shoulders and turned\\nback into the drawing-room, shutting the door sharply.  Her bosom was\\nrising high under its lace, and for a moment Archer thought she was\\nabout to cry; but she burst into a laugh instead, and looking from the\\nMarchioness to Archer, asked abruptly: \"And you two--have you made\\nfriends!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s for Mr. Archer to say, darling; he has waited patiently while you\\nwere dressing.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--I gave you time enough: my hair wouldn\\'t go,\" Madame Olenska\\nsaid, raising her hand to the heaped-up curls of her chignon.  \"But\\nthat reminds me: I see Dr. Carver is gone, and you\\'ll be late at the\\nBlenkers\\'.  Mr. Archer, will you put my aunt in the carriage?\"\\n\\nShe followed the Marchioness into the hall, saw her fitted into a\\nmiscellaneous heap of overshoes, shawls and tippets, and called from\\nthe doorstep:  \"Mind, the carriage is to be back for me at ten!\"  Then\\nshe returned to the drawing-room, where Archer, on re-entering it,\\nfound her standing by the mantelpiece, examining herself in the mirror.\\nIt was not usual, in New York society, for a lady to address her\\nparlour-maid as \"my dear one,\" and send her out on an errand wrapped in\\nher own opera-cloak; and Archer, through all his deeper feelings,\\ntasted the pleasurable excitement of being in a world where action\\nfollowed on emotion with such Olympian speed.\\n\\nMadame Olenska did not move when he came up behind her, and for a\\nsecond their eyes met in the mirror; then she turned, threw herself\\ninto her sofa-corner, and sighed out:  \"There\\'s time for a cigarette.\"\\n\\nHe handed her the box and lit a spill for her; and as the flame flashed\\nup into her face she glanced at him with laughing eyes and said:  \"What\\ndo you think of me in a temper?\"\\n\\nArcher paused a moment; then he answered with sudden resolution:  \"It\\nmakes me understand what your aunt has been saying about you.\"\\n\\n\"I knew she\\'d been talking about me.  Well?\"\\n\\n\"She said you were used to all kinds of things--splendours and\\namusements and excitements--that we could never hope to give you here.\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska smiled faintly into the circle of smoke about her lips.\\n\\n\"Medora is incorrigibly romantic.  It has made up to her for so many\\nthings!\"\\n\\nArcher hesitated again, and again took his risk.  \"Is your aunt\\'s\\nromanticism always consistent with accuracy?\"\\n\\n\"You mean: does she speak the truth?\"  Her niece considered.  \"Well,\\nI\\'ll tell you: in almost everything she says, there\\'s something true\\nand something untrue.  But why do you ask?  What has she been telling\\nyou?\"\\n\\nHe looked away into the fire, and then back at her shining presence.\\nHis heart tightened with the thought that this was their last evening\\nby that fireside, and that in a moment the carriage would come to carry\\nher away.\\n\\n\"She says--she pretends that Count Olenski has asked her to persuade\\nyou to go back to him.\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska made no answer.  She sat motionless, holding her\\ncigarette in her half-lifted hand.  The expression of her face had not\\nchanged; and Archer remembered that he had before noticed her apparent\\nincapacity for surprise.\\n\\n\"You knew, then?\" he broke out.\\n\\nShe was silent for so long that the ash dropped from her cigarette.\\nShe brushed it to the floor.  \"She has hinted about a letter: poor\\ndarling!  Medora\\'s hints--\"\\n\\n\"Is it at your husband\\'s request that she has arrived here suddenly?\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska seemed to consider this question also.  \"There again:\\none can\\'t tell.  She told me she had had a \\'spiritual summons,\\'\\nwhatever that is, from Dr. Carver.  I\\'m afraid she\\'s going to marry Dr.\\nCarver ...  poor Medora, there\\'s always some one she wants to marry.\\nBut perhaps the people in Cuba just got tired of her!  I think she was\\nwith them as a sort of paid companion.  Really, I don\\'t know why she\\ncame.\"\\n\\n\"But you do believe she has a letter from your husband?\"\\n\\nAgain Madame Olenska brooded silently; then she said:  \"After all, it\\nwas to be expected.\"\\n\\nThe young man rose and went to lean against the fireplace.  A sudden\\nrestlessness possessed him, and he was tongue-tied by the sense that\\ntheir minutes were numbered, and that at any moment he might hear the\\nwheels of the returning carriage.\\n\\n\"You know that your aunt believes you will go back?\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska raised her head quickly.  A deep blush rose to her face\\nand spread over her neck and shoulders.  She blushed seldom and\\npainfully, as if it hurt her like a burn.\\n\\n\"Many cruel things have been believed of me,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Oh, Ellen--forgive me; I\\'m a fool and a brute!\"\\n\\nShe smiled a little.  \"You are horribly nervous; you have your own\\ntroubles.  I know you think the Wellands are unreasonable about your\\nmarriage, and of course I agree with you.  In Europe people don\\'t\\nunderstand our long American engagements; I suppose they are not as\\ncalm as we are.\"  She pronounced the \"we\" with a faint emphasis that\\ngave it an ironic sound.\\n\\nArcher felt the irony but did not dare to take it up.  After all, she\\nhad perhaps purposely deflected the conversation from her own affairs,\\nand after the pain his last words had evidently caused her he felt that\\nall he could do was to follow her lead.  But the sense of the waning\\nhour made him desperate: he could not bear the thought that a barrier\\nof words should drop between them again.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he said abruptly; \"I went south to ask May to marry me after\\nEaster.  There\\'s no reason why we shouldn\\'t be married then.\"\\n\\n\"And May adores you--and yet you couldn\\'t convince her?  I thought her\\ntoo intelligent to be the slave of such absurd superstitions.\"\\n\\n\"She IS too intelligent--she\\'s not their slave.\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska looked at him.  \"Well, then--I don\\'t understand.\"\\n\\nArcher reddened, and hurried on with a rush.  \"We had a frank\\ntalk--almost the first.  She thinks my impatience a bad sign.\"\\n\\n\"Merciful heavens--a bad sign?\"\\n\\n\"She thinks it means that I can\\'t trust myself to go on caring for her.\\nShe thinks, in short, I want to marry her at once to get away from some\\none that I--care for more.\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska examined this curiously.  \"But if she thinks that--why\\nisn\\'t she in a hurry too?\"\\n\\n\"Because she\\'s not like that: she\\'s so much nobler.  She insists all\\nthe more on the long engagement, to give me time--\"\\n\\n\"Time to give her up for the other woman?\"\\n\\n\"If I want to.\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska leaned toward the fire and gazed into it with fixed\\neyes.  Down the quiet street Archer heard the approaching trot of her\\nhorses.\\n\\n\"That IS noble,\" she said, with a slight break in her voice.\\n\\n\"Yes.  But it\\'s ridiculous.\"\\n\\n\"Ridiculous?  Because you don\\'t care for any one else?\"\\n\\n\"Because I don\\'t mean to marry any one else.\"\\n\\n\"Ah.\"  There was another long interval.  At length she looked up at him\\nand asked:  \"This other woman--does she love you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, there\\'s no other woman; I mean, the person that May was thinking\\nof is--was never--\"\\n\\n\"Then, why, after all, are you in such haste?\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s your carriage,\" said Archer.\\n\\nShe half-rose and looked about her with absent eyes.  Her fan and\\ngloves lay on the sofa beside her and she picked them up mechanically.\\n\\n\"Yes; I suppose I must be going.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re going to Mrs. Struthers\\'s?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"  She smiled and added:  \"I must go where I am invited, or I\\nshould be too lonely.  Why not come with me?\"\\n\\nArcher felt that at any cost he must keep her beside him, must make her\\ngive him the rest of her evening.  Ignoring her question, he continued\\nto lean against the chimney-piece, his eyes fixed on the hand in which\\nshe held her gloves and fan, as if watching to see if he had the power\\nto make her drop them.\\n\\n\"May guessed the truth,\" he said.  \"There is another woman--but not the\\none she thinks.\"\\n\\nEllen Olenska made no answer, and did not move.  After a moment he sat\\ndown beside her, and, taking her hand, softly unclasped it, so that the\\ngloves and fan fell on the sofa between them.\\n\\nShe started up, and freeing herself from him moved away to the other\\nside of the hearth.  \"Ah, don\\'t make love to me!  Too many people have\\ndone that,\" she said, frowning.\\n\\nArcher, changing colour, stood up also: it was the bitterest rebuke she\\ncould have given him.  \"I have never made love to you,\" he said, \"and I\\nnever shall.  But you are the woman I would have married if it had been\\npossible for either of us.\"\\n\\n\"Possible for either of us?\"  She looked at him with unfeigned\\nastonishment.  \"And you say that--when it\\'s you who\\'ve made it\\nimpossible?\"\\n\\nHe stared at her, groping in a blackness through which a single arrow\\nof light tore its blinding way.\\n\\n\"I\\'VE made it impossible--?\"\\n\\n\"You, you, YOU!\" she cried, her lip trembling like a child\\'s on the\\nverge of tears.  \"Isn\\'t it you who made me give up divorcing--give it\\nup because you showed me how selfish and wicked it was, how one must\\nsacrifice one\\'s self to preserve the dignity of marriage ... and to\\nspare one\\'s family the publicity, the scandal?  And because my family\\nwas going to be your family--for May\\'s sake and for yours--I did what\\nyou told me, what you proved to me that I ought to do.  Ah,\" she broke\\nout with a sudden laugh, \"I\\'ve made no secret of having done it for\\nyou!\"\\n\\nShe sank down on the sofa again, crouching among the festive ripples of\\nher dress like a stricken masquerader; and the young man stood by the\\nfireplace and continued to gaze at her without moving.\\n\\n\"Good God,\" he groaned.  \"When I thought--\"\\n\\n\"You thought?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, don\\'t ask me what I thought!\"\\n\\nStill looking at her, he saw the same burning flush creep up her neck\\nto her face.  She sat upright, facing him with a rigid dignity.\\n\\n\"I do ask you.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then: there were things in that letter you asked me to read--\"\\n\\n\"My husband\\'s letter?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"I had nothing to fear from that letter: absolutely nothing!  All I\\nfeared was to bring notoriety, scandal, on the family--on you and May.\"\\n\\n\"Good God,\" he groaned again, bowing his face in his hands.\\n\\nThe silence that followed lay on them with the weight of things final\\nand irrevocable.  It seemed to Archer to be crushing him down like his\\nown grave-stone; in all the wide future he saw nothing that would ever\\nlift that load from his heart.  He did not move from his place, or\\nraise his head from his hands; his hidden eyeballs went on staring into\\nutter darkness.\\n\\n\"At least I loved you--\" he brought out.\\n\\nOn the other side of the hearth, from the sofa-corner where he supposed\\nthat she still crouched, he heard a faint stifled crying like a\\nchild\\'s.  He started up and came to her side.\\n\\n\"Ellen!  What madness!  Why are you crying?  Nothing\\'s done that can\\'t\\nbe undone.  I\\'m still free, and you\\'re going to be.\"  He had her in his\\narms, her face like a wet flower at his lips, and all their vain\\nterrors shrivelling up like ghosts at sunrise.  The one thing that\\nastonished him now was that he should have stood for five minutes\\narguing with her across the width of the room, when just touching her\\nmade everything so simple.\\n\\nShe gave him back all his kiss, but after a moment he felt her\\nstiffening in his arms, and she put him aside and stood up.\\n\\n\"Ah, my poor Newland--I suppose this had to be.  But it doesn\\'t in the\\nleast alter things,\" she said, looking down at him in her turn from the\\nhearth.\\n\\n\"It alters the whole of life for me.\"\\n\\n\"No, no--it mustn\\'t, it can\\'t.  You\\'re engaged to May Welland; and I\\'m\\nmarried.\"\\n\\nHe stood up too, flushed and resolute.  \"Nonsense!  It\\'s too late for\\nthat sort of thing.  We\\'ve no right to lie to other people or to\\nourselves.  We won\\'t talk of your marriage; but do you see me marrying\\nMay after this?\"\\n\\nShe stood silent, resting her thin elbows on the mantelpiece, her\\nprofile reflected in the glass behind her.  One of the locks of her\\nchignon had become loosened and hung on her neck; she looked haggard\\nand almost old.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see you,\" she said at length, \"putting that question to May.\\nDo you?\"\\n\\nHe gave a reckless shrug.  \"It\\'s too late to do anything else.\"\\n\\n\"You say that because it\\'s the easiest thing to say at this moment--not\\nbecause it\\'s true.  In reality it\\'s too late to do anything but what\\nwe\\'d both decided on.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, I don\\'t understand you!\"\\n\\nShe forced a pitiful smile that pinched her face instead of smoothing\\nit.  \"You don\\'t understand because you haven\\'t yet guessed how you\\'ve\\nchanged things for me: oh, from the first--long before I knew all you\\'d\\ndone.\"\\n\\n\"All I\\'d done?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.  I was perfectly unconscious at first that people here were shy\\nof me--that they thought I was a dreadful sort of person.  It seems\\nthey had even refused to meet me at dinner.  I found that out\\nafterward; and how you\\'d made your mother go with you to the van der\\nLuydens\\'; and how you\\'d insisted on announcing your engagement at the\\nBeaufort ball, so that I might have two families to stand by me instead\\nof one--\"\\n\\nAt that he broke into a laugh.\\n\\n\"Just imagine,\" she said, \"how stupid and unobservant I was!  I knew\\nnothing of all this till Granny blurted it out one day.  New York\\nsimply meant peace and freedom to me: it was coming home.  And I was so\\nhappy at being among my own people that every one I met seemed kind and\\ngood, and glad to see me.  But from the very beginning,\" she continued,\\n\"I felt there was no one as kind as you; no one who gave me reasons\\nthat I understood for doing what at first seemed so hard\\nand--unnecessary.  The very good people didn\\'t convince me; I felt\\nthey\\'d never been tempted.  But you knew; you understood; you had felt\\nthe world outside tugging at one with all its golden hands--and yet you\\nhated the things it asks of one; you hated happiness bought by\\ndisloyalty and cruelty and indifference.  That was what I\\'d never known\\nbefore--and it\\'s better than anything I\\'ve known.\"\\n\\nShe spoke in a low even voice, without tears or visible agitation; and\\neach word, as it dropped from her, fell into his breast like burning\\nlead.  He sat bowed over, his head between his hands, staring at the\\nhearthrug, and at the tip of the satin shoe that showed under her\\ndress.  Suddenly he knelt down and kissed the shoe.\\n\\nShe bent over him, laying her hands on his shoulders, and looking at\\nhim with eyes so deep that he remained motionless under her gaze.\\n\\n\"Ah, don\\'t let us undo what you\\'ve done!\" she cried.  \"I can\\'t go back\\nnow to that other way of thinking.  I can\\'t love you unless I give you\\nup.\"\\n\\nHis arms were yearning up to her; but she drew away, and they remained\\nfacing each other, divided by the distance that her words had created.\\nThen, abruptly, his anger overflowed.\\n\\n\"And Beaufort?  Is he to replace me?\"\\n\\nAs the words sprang out he was prepared for an answering flare of\\nanger; and he would have welcomed it as fuel for his own.  But Madame\\nOlenska only grew a shade paler, and stood with her arms hanging down\\nbefore her, and her head slightly bent, as her way was when she\\npondered a question.\\n\\n\"He\\'s waiting for you now at Mrs. Struthers\\'s; why don\\'t you go to\\nhim?\" Archer sneered.\\n\\nShe turned to ring the bell.  \"I shall not go out this evening; tell\\nthe carriage to go and fetch the Signora Marchesa,\" she said when the\\nmaid came.\\n\\nAfter the door had closed again Archer continued to look at her with\\nbitter eyes.  \"Why this sacrifice?  Since you tell me that you\\'re\\nlonely I\\'ve no right to keep you from your friends.\"\\n\\nShe smiled a little under her wet lashes.  \"I shan\\'t be lonely now.  I\\nWAS lonely; I WAS afraid.  But the emptiness and the darkness are gone;\\nwhen I turn back into myself now I\\'m like a child going at night into a\\nroom where there\\'s always a light.\"\\n\\nHer tone and her look still enveloped her in a soft inaccessibility,\\nand Archer groaned out again:  \"I don\\'t understand you!\"\\n\\n\"Yet you understand May!\"\\n\\nHe reddened under the retort, but kept his eyes on her.  \"May is ready\\nto give me up.\"\\n\\n\"What!  Three days after you\\'ve entreated her on your knees to hasten\\nyour marriage?\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s refused; that gives me the right--\"\\n\\n\"Ah, you\\'ve taught me what an ugly word that is,\" she said.\\n\\nHe turned away with a sense of utter weariness.  He felt as though he\\nhad been struggling for hours up the face of a steep precipice, and\\nnow, just as he had fought his way to the top, his hold had given way\\nand he was pitching down headlong into darkness.\\n\\nIf he could have got her in his arms again he might have swept away her\\narguments; but she still held him at a distance by something\\ninscrutably aloof in her look and attitude, and by his own awed sense\\nof her sincerity.  At length he began to plead again.\\n\\n\"If we do this now it will be worse afterward--worse for every one--\"\\n\\n\"No--no--no!\" she almost screamed, as if he frightened her.\\n\\nAt that moment the bell sent a long tinkle through the house.  They had\\nheard no carriage stopping at the door, and they stood motionless,\\nlooking at each other with startled eyes.\\n\\nOutside, Nastasia\\'s step crossed the hall, the outer door opened, and a\\nmoment later she came in carrying a telegram which she handed to the\\nCountess Olenska.\\n\\n\"The lady was very happy at the flowers,\" Nastasia said, smoothing her\\napron.  \"She thought it was her signor marito who had sent them, and\\nshe cried a little and said it was a folly.\"\\n\\nHer mistress smiled and took the yellow envelope.  She tore it open and\\ncarried it to the lamp; then, when the door had closed again, she\\nhanded the telegram to Archer.\\n\\nIt was dated from St. Augustine, and addressed to the Countess Olenska.\\nIn it he read:  \"Granny\\'s telegram successful.  Papa and Mamma agree\\nmarriage after Easter.  Am telegraphing Newland.  Am too happy for\\nwords and love you dearly.  Your grateful May.\"\\n\\n\\nHalf an hour later, when Archer unlocked his own front-door, he found a\\nsimilar envelope on the hall-table on top of his pile of notes and\\nletters.  The message inside the envelope was also from May Welland,\\nand ran as follows:  \"Parents consent wedding Tuesday after Easter at\\ntwelve Grace Church eight bridesmaids please see Rector so happy love\\nMay.\"\\n\\nArcher crumpled up the yellow sheet as if the gesture could annihilate\\nthe news it contained.  Then he pulled out a small pocket-diary and\\nturned over the pages with trembling fingers; but he did not find what\\nhe wanted, and cramming the telegram into his pocket he mounted the\\nstairs.\\n\\nA light was shining through the door of the little hall-room which\\nserved Janey as a dressing-room and boudoir, and her brother rapped\\nimpatiently on the panel.  The door opened, and his sister stood before\\nhim in her immemorial purple flannel dressing-gown, with her hair \"on\\npins.\"  Her face looked pale and apprehensive.\\n\\n\"Newland!  I hope there\\'s no bad news in that telegram?  I waited on\\npurpose, in case--\"  (No item of his correspondence was safe from\\nJaney.)\\n\\nHe took no notice of her question.  \"Look here--what day is Easter this\\nyear?\"\\n\\nShe looked shocked at such unchristian ignorance.  \"Easter?  Newland!\\nWhy, of course, the first week in April.  Why?\"\\n\\n\"The first week?\"  He turned again to the pages of his diary,\\ncalculating rapidly under his breath.  \"The first week, did you say?\"\\nHe threw back his head with a long laugh.\\n\\n\"For mercy\\'s sake what\\'s the matter?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing\\'s the matter, except that I\\'m going to be married in a month.\"\\n\\nJaney fell upon his neck and pressed him to her purple flannel breast.\\n\"Oh Newland, how wonderful!  I\\'m so glad!  But, dearest, why do you\\nkeep on laughing?  Do hush, or you\\'ll wake Mamma.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBook II\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              "  {'chapter-content': '\\nThe next morning, when Archer got out of the Fall River train, he\\nemerged upon a steaming midsummer Boston.  The streets near the station\\nwere full of the smell of beer and coffee and decaying fruit and a\\nshirt-sleeved populace moved through them with the intimate abandon of\\nboarders going down the passage to the bathroom.\\n\\nArcher found a cab and drove to the Somerset Club for breakfast.  Even\\nthe fashionable quarters had the air of untidy domesticity to which no\\nexcess of heat ever degrades the European cities.  Care-takers in\\ncalico lounged on the door-steps of the wealthy, and the Common looked\\nlike a pleasure-ground on the morrow of a Masonic picnic.  If Archer\\nhad tried to imagine Ellen Olenska in improbable scenes he could not\\nhave called up any into which it was more difficult to fit her than\\nthis heat-prostrated and deserted Boston.\\n\\nHe breakfasted with appetite and method, beginning with a slice of\\nmelon, and studying a morning paper while he waited for his toast and\\nscrambled eggs.  A new sense of energy and activity had possessed him\\never since he had announced to May the night before that he had\\nbusiness in Boston, and should take the Fall River boat that night and\\ngo on to New York the following evening.  It had always been understood\\nthat he would return to town early in the week, and when he got back\\nfrom his expedition to Portsmouth a letter from the office, which fate\\nhad conspicuously placed on a corner of the hall table, sufficed to\\njustify his sudden change of plan.  He was even ashamed of the ease\\nwith which the whole thing had been done: it reminded him, for an\\nuncomfortable moment, of Lawrence Lefferts\\'s masterly contrivances for\\nsecuring his freedom.  But this did not long trouble him, for he was\\nnot in an analytic mood.\\n\\nAfter breakfast he smoked a cigarette and glanced over the Commercial\\nAdvertiser.  While he was thus engaged two or three men he knew came\\nin, and the usual greetings were exchanged: it was the same world after\\nall, though he had such a queer sense of having slipped through the\\nmeshes of time and space.\\n\\nHe looked at his watch, and finding that it was half-past nine got up\\nand went into the writing-room.  There he wrote a few lines, and\\nordered a messenger to take a cab to the Parker House and wait for the\\nanswer.  He then sat down behind another newspaper and tried to\\ncalculate how long it would take a cab to get to the Parker House.\\n\\n\"The lady was out, sir,\" he suddenly heard a waiter\\'s voice at his\\nelbow; and he stammered:  \"Out?--\" as if it were a word in a strange\\nlanguage.\\n\\nHe got up and went into the hall.  It must be a mistake: she could not\\nbe out at that hour.  He flushed with anger at his own stupidity: why\\nhad he not sent the note as soon as he arrived?\\n\\nHe found his hat and stick and went forth into the street.  The city\\nhad suddenly become as strange and vast and empty as if he were a\\ntraveller from distant lands.  For a moment he stood on the door-step\\nhesitating; then he decided to go to the Parker House.  What if the\\nmessenger had been misinformed, and she were still there?\\n\\nHe started to walk across the Common; and on the first bench, under a\\ntree, he saw her sitting.  She had a grey silk sunshade over her\\nhead--how could he ever have imagined her with a pink one?  As he\\napproached he was struck by her listless attitude: she sat there as if\\nshe had nothing else to do.  He saw her drooping profile, and the knot\\nof hair fastened low in the neck under her dark hat, and the long\\nwrinkled glove on the hand that held the sunshade.  He came a step or\\ntwo nearer, and she turned and looked at him.\\n\\n\"Oh\"--she said; and for the first time he noticed a startled look on\\nher face; but in another moment it gave way to a slow smile of wonder\\nand contentment.\\n\\n\"Oh\"--she murmured again, on a different note, as he stood looking down\\nat her; and without rising she made a place for him on the bench.\\n\\n\"I\\'m here on business--just got here,\" Archer explained; and, without\\nknowing why, he suddenly began to feign astonishment at seeing her.\\n\"But what on earth are you doing in this wilderness?\"  He had really no\\nidea what he was saying: he felt as if he were shouting at her across\\nendless distances, and she might vanish again before he could overtake\\nher.\\n\\n\"I?  Oh, I\\'m here on business too,\" she answered, turning her head\\ntoward him so that they were face to face.  The words hardly reached\\nhim: he was aware only of her voice, and of the startling fact that not\\nan echo of it had remained in his memory.  He had not even remembered\\nthat it was low-pitched, with a faint roughness on the consonants.\\n\\n\"You do your hair differently,\" he said, his heart beating as if he had\\nuttered something irrevocable.\\n\\n\"Differently?  No--it\\'s only that I do it as best I can when I\\'m\\nwithout Nastasia.\"\\n\\n\"Nastasia; but isn\\'t she with you?\"\\n\\n\"No; I\\'m alone.  For two days it was not worth while to bring her.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re alone--at the Parker House?\"\\n\\nShe looked at him with a flash of her old malice.  \"Does it strike you\\nas dangerous?\"\\n\\n\"No; not dangerous--\"\\n\\n\"But unconventional?  I see; I suppose it is.\"  She considered a\\nmoment.  \"I hadn\\'t thought of it, because I\\'ve just done something so\\nmuch more unconventional.\" The faint tinge of irony lingered in her\\neyes.  \"I\\'ve just refused to take back a sum of money--that belonged to\\nme.\"\\n\\nArcher sprang up and moved a step or two away.  She had furled her\\nparasol and sat absently drawing patterns on the gravel.  Presently he\\ncame back and stood before her.\\n\\n\"Some one--has come here to meet you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"With this offer?\"\\n\\nShe nodded.\\n\\n\"And you refused--because of the conditions?\"\\n\\n\"I refused,\" she said after a moment.\\n\\nHe sat down by her again.  \"What were the conditions?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, they were not onerous: just to sit at the head of his table now\\nand then.\"\\n\\nThere was another interval of silence.  Archer\\'s heart had slammed\\nitself shut in the queer way it had, and he sat vainly groping for a\\nword.\\n\\n\"He wants you back--at any price?\"\\n\\n\"Well--a considerable price.  At least the sum is considerable for me.\"\\n\\nHe paused again, beating about the question he felt he must put.\\n\\n\"It was to meet him here that you came?\"\\n\\nShe stared, and then burst into a laugh.  \"Meet him--my husband?  HERE?\\nAt this season he\\'s always at Cowes or Baden.\"\\n\\n\"He sent some one?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"With a letter?\"\\n\\nShe shook her head.  \"No; just a message.  He never writes.  I don\\'t\\nthink I\\'ve had more than one letter from him.\"  The allusion brought\\nthe colour to her cheek, and it reflected itself in Archer\\'s vivid\\nblush.\\n\\n\"Why does he never write?\"\\n\\n\"Why should he?  What does one have secretaries for?\"\\n\\nThe young man\\'s blush deepened.  She had pronounced the word as if it\\nhad no more significance than any other in her vocabulary.  For a\\nmoment it was on the tip of his tongue to ask:  \"Did he send his\\nsecretary, then?\"  But the remembrance of Count Olenski\\'s only letter\\nto his wife was too present to him.  He paused again, and then took\\nanother plunge.\\n\\n\"And the person?\"--\\n\\n\"The emissary?  The emissary,\" Madame Olenska rejoined, still smiling,\\n\"might, for all I care, have left already; but he has insisted on\\nwaiting till this evening ... in case ... on the chance ...\"\\n\\n\"And you came out here to think the chance over?\"\\n\\n\"I came out to get a breath of air.  The hotel\\'s too stifling.  I\\'m\\ntaking the afternoon train back to Portsmouth.\"\\n\\nThey sat silent, not looking at each other, but straight ahead at the\\npeople passing along the path.  Finally she turned her eyes again to\\nhis face and said:  \"You\\'re not changed.\"\\n\\nHe felt like answering:  \"I was, till I saw you again;\" but instead he\\nstood up abruptly and glanced about him at the untidy sweltering park.\\n\\n\"This is horrible.  Why shouldn\\'t we go out a little on the bay?\\nThere\\'s a breeze, and it will be cooler.  We might take the steamboat\\ndown to Point Arley.\"  She glanced up at him hesitatingly and he went\\non:  \"On a Monday morning there won\\'t be anybody on the boat.  My train\\ndoesn\\'t leave till evening: I\\'m going back to New York.  Why shouldn\\'t\\nwe?\" he insisted, looking down at her; and suddenly he broke out:\\n\"Haven\\'t we done all we could?\"\\n\\n\"Oh\"--she murmured again.  She stood up and reopened her sunshade,\\nglancing about her as if to take counsel of the scene, and assure\\nherself of the impossibility of remaining in it.  Then her eyes\\nreturned to his face.  \"You mustn\\'t say things like that to me,\" she\\nsaid.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll say anything you like; or nothing.  I won\\'t open my mouth unless\\nyou tell me to.  What harm can it do to anybody?  All I want is to\\nlisten to you,\" he stammered.\\n\\nShe drew out a little gold-faced watch on an enamelled chain.  \"Oh,\\ndon\\'t calculate,\" he broke out; \"give me the day!  I want to get you\\naway from that man.  At what time was he coming?\"\\n\\nHer colour rose again.  \"At eleven.\"\\n\\n\"Then you must come at once.\"\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t be afraid--if I don\\'t come.\"\\n\\n\"Nor you either--if you do.  I swear I only want to hear about you, to\\nknow what you\\'ve been doing.  It\\'s a hundred years since we\\'ve met--it\\nmay be another hundred before we meet again.\"\\n\\nShe still wavered, her anxious eyes on his face.  \"Why didn\\'t you come\\ndown to the beach to fetch me, the day I was at Granny\\'s?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Because you didn\\'t look round--because you didn\\'t know I was there.  I\\nswore I wouldn\\'t unless you looked round.\"  He laughed as the\\nchildishness of the confession struck him.\\n\\n\"But I didn\\'t look round on purpose.\"\\n\\n\"On purpose?\"\\n\\n\"I knew you were there; when you drove in I recognised the ponies.  So\\nI went down to the beach.\"\\n\\n\"To get away from me as far as you could?\"\\n\\nShe repeated in a low voice:  \"To get away from you as far as I could.\"\\n\\nHe laughed out again, this time in boyish satisfaction.  \"Well, you see\\nit\\'s no use.  I may as well tell you,\" he added, \"that the business I\\ncame here for was just to find you.  But, look here, we must start or\\nwe shall miss our boat.\"\\n\\n\"Our boat?\"  She frowned perplexedly, and then smiled.  \"Oh, but I must\\ngo back to the hotel first:  I must leave a note--\"\\n\\n\"As many notes as you please.  You can write here.\" He drew out a\\nnote-case and one of the new stylographic pens.  \"I\\'ve even got an\\nenvelope--you see how everything\\'s predestined!  There--steady the\\nthing on your knee, and I\\'ll get the pen going in a second.  They have\\nto be humoured; wait--\"  He banged the hand that held the pen against\\nthe back of the bench.  \"It\\'s like jerking down the mercury in a\\nthermometer: just a trick.  Now try--\"\\n\\nShe laughed, and bending over the sheet of paper which he had laid on\\nhis note-case, began to write.  Archer walked away a few steps, staring\\nwith radiant unseeing eyes at the passersby, who, in their turn, paused\\nto stare at the unwonted sight of a fashionably-dressed lady writing a\\nnote on her knee on a bench in the Common.\\n\\nMadame Olenska slipped the sheet into the envelope, wrote a name on it,\\nand put it into her pocket.  Then she too stood up.\\n\\nThey walked back toward Beacon Street, and near the club Archer caught\\nsight of the plush-lined \"herdic\" which had carried his note to the\\nParker House, and whose driver was reposing from this effort by bathing\\nhis brow at the corner hydrant.\\n\\n\"I told you everything was predestined!  Here\\'s a cab for us.  You\\nsee!\"  They laughed, astonished at the miracle of picking up a public\\nconveyance at that hour, and in that unlikely spot, in a city where\\ncab-stands were still a \"foreign\" novelty.\\n\\nArcher, looking at his watch, saw that there was time to drive to the\\nParker House before going to the steamboat landing.  They rattled\\nthrough the hot streets and drew up at the door of the hotel.\\n\\nArcher held out his hand for the letter.  \"Shall I take it in?\" he\\nasked; but Madame Olenska, shaking her head, sprang out and disappeared\\nthrough the glazed doors.  It was barely half-past ten; but what if the\\nemissary, impatient for her reply, and not knowing how else to employ\\nhis time, were already seated among the travellers with cooling drinks\\nat their elbows of whom Archer had caught a glimpse as she went in?\\n\\nHe waited, pacing up and down before the herdic.  A Sicilian youth with\\neyes like Nastasia\\'s offered to shine his boots, and an Irish matron to\\nsell him peaches; and every few moments the doors opened to let out hot\\nmen with straw hats tilted far back, who glanced at him as they went\\nby.  He marvelled that the door should open so often, and that all the\\npeople it let out should look so like each other, and so like all the\\nother hot men who, at that hour, through the length and breadth of the\\nland, were passing continuously in and out of the swinging doors of\\nhotels.\\n\\nAnd then, suddenly, came a face that he could not relate to the other\\nfaces.  He caught but a flash of it, for his pacings had carried him to\\nthe farthest point of his beat, and it was in turning back to the hotel\\nthat he saw, in a group of typical countenances--the lank and weary,\\nthe round and surprised, the lantern-jawed and mild--this other face\\nthat was so many more things at once, and things so different.  It was\\nthat of a young man, pale too, and half-extinguished by the heat, or\\nworry, or both, but somehow, quicker, vivider, more conscious; or\\nperhaps seeming so because he was so different.  Archer hung a moment\\non a thin thread of memory, but it snapped and floated off with the\\ndisappearing face--apparently that of some foreign business man,\\nlooking doubly foreign in such a setting.  He vanished in the stream of\\npassersby, and Archer resumed his patrol.\\n\\nHe did not care to be seen watch in hand within view of the hotel, and\\nhis unaided reckoning of the lapse of time led him to conclude that, if\\nMadame Olenska was so long in reappearing, it could only be because she\\nhad met the emissary and been waylaid by him.  At the thought Archer\\'s\\napprehension rose to anguish.\\n\\n\"If she doesn\\'t come soon I\\'ll go in and find her,\" he said.\\n\\nThe doors swung open again and she was at his side.  They got into the\\nherdic, and as it drove off he took out his watch and saw that she had\\nbeen absent just three minutes.  In the clatter of loose windows that\\nmade talk impossible they bumped over the disjointed cobblestones to\\nthe wharf.\\n\\n\\nSeated side by side on a bench of the half-empty boat they found that\\nthey had hardly anything to say to each other, or rather that what they\\nhad to say communicated itself best in the blessed silence of their\\nrelease and their isolation.\\n\\nAs the paddle-wheels began to turn, and wharves and shipping to recede\\nthrough the veil of heat, it seemed to Archer that everything in the\\nold familiar world of habit was receding also.  He longed to ask Madame\\nOlenska if she did not have the same feeling: the feeling that they\\nwere starting on some long voyage from which they might never return.\\nBut he was afraid to say it, or anything else that might disturb the\\ndelicate balance of her trust in him.  In reality he had no wish to\\nbetray that trust.  There had been days and nights when the memory of\\ntheir kiss had burned and burned on his lips; the day before even, on\\nthe drive to Portsmouth, the thought of her had run through him like\\nfire; but now that she was beside him, and they were drifting forth\\ninto this unknown world, they seemed to have reached the kind of deeper\\nnearness that a touch may sunder.\\n\\nAs the boat left the harbour and turned seaward a breeze stirred about\\nthem and the bay broke up into long oily undulations, then into ripples\\ntipped with spray.  The fog of sultriness still hung over the city, but\\nahead lay a fresh world of ruffled waters, and distant promontories\\nwith light-houses in the sun.  Madame Olenska, leaning back against the\\nboat-rail, drank in the coolness between parted lips.  She had wound a\\nlong veil about her hat, but it left her face uncovered, and Archer was\\nstruck by the tranquil gaiety of her expression.  She seemed to take\\ntheir adventure as a matter of course, and to be neither in fear of\\nunexpected encounters, nor (what was worse) unduly elated by their\\npossibility.\\n\\nIn the bare dining-room of the inn, which he had hoped they would have\\nto themselves, they found a strident party of innocent-looking young\\nmen and women--school-teachers on a holiday, the landlord told\\nthem--and Archer\\'s heart sank at the idea of having to talk through\\ntheir noise.\\n\\n\"This is hopeless--I\\'ll ask for a private room,\" he said; and Madame\\nOlenska, without offering any objection, waited while he went in search\\nof it.  The room opened on a long wooden verandah, with the sea coming\\nin at the windows.  It was bare and cool, with a table covered with a\\ncoarse checkered cloth and adorned by a bottle of pickles and a\\nblueberry pie under a cage.  No more guileless-looking cabinet\\nparticulier ever offered its shelter to a clandestine couple: Archer\\nfancied he saw the sense of its reassurance in the faintly amused smile\\nwith which Madame Olenska sat down opposite to him.  A woman who had\\nrun away from her husband--and reputedly with another man--was likely\\nto have mastered the art of taking things for granted; but something in\\nthe quality of her composure took the edge from his irony.  By being so\\nquiet, so unsurprised and so simple she had managed to brush away the\\nconventions and make him feel that to seek to be alone was the natural\\nthing for two old friends who had so much to say to each other....\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Newland Archer enters his opera box and looks out across the theater to see his girlfriend, May Welland, touch the lilies he had given her. While dreaming of their future together, his thoughts are interrupted by gasps from the gentlemen sitting with him. They are whispering about a fashionably dressed woman who has just sat down in the box with May. Sillerton Jackson gasps, \\\\\"I did not think they would have tried it on,\\\\\" which means, he can1t believe the Mingotts would allow the woman to come and sit in their box at the Opera.\", \"analysis\": \"This is a book about the conventions of \\\\\"Old New York\\\\\", New York City in the 18701s. Wharton loves contrasting the old against the new. She begins these contrasts in the very first paragraph. Here she describes the new Opera theater that is going to be erected in the \\\\\"remote\\\\\" forties. We can assume that the forties have been built up since then and people reading her book in the 19201s  would enjoy hearing about how New York has changed. Along these lines, there is also a description of the old people versus the \\\\\"new people, whom NY was beginning to dread and yet be drawn to. Also important in this first chapter is Wharton1s discussion of fashionability and propriety. We can tell from the way that Newland Archer, Lawrence Lefferts and Mr. Silverton Jackson are introduced that Wharton will spend a lot of time in the novel discussing and perhaps critiquing these concepts in the book. Of note, as well, is the great attention to detail that Wharton has. The way she describes clothing and interior decoration with much detail has led many to dub this book a \\\\\"costume novel\\\\\". We will have to see for ourselves if the book develops beyond being a \\\\\"bodice ripper\\\\\" sort of book. May Welland will be one of the most important characters in the book. She is holding Lillies of the Valley. In the 18701s the lily of the valley was the flower of chastity and of the names Cynthia and Diana. Later in the book, May is often compared to Diana, the Greek goddess of the hunt\"}'"

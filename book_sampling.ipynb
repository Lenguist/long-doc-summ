Edgar was not dead yet, but soon would be. Ellen asked Linton where Catherine was, and he answered that she was shut upstairs, that they were married, and that he was glad she was being treated harshly. Apparently he resented that she hadn\\'t wished to marry him. He was annoyed by her crying, and was glad when Heathcliff struck her as punishment. Ellen rebuked Linton for his selfishness and unkindness, and went to the Grange to get help. Edgar was glad to hear his daughter was safe and would be home soon: he was almost dead, at the age of 39. Upon hearing of Heathcliff\\'s plot to take control of his estate, Edgar sent for Mr. Green, the local attorney, to change his will so that his money would be held in a trust for Cathy. However, Heathcliff bought off Mr. Green and the lawyer did not arrive until it was too late to change the will. The men sent to Wuthering Heights to rescue Cathy returned without her, having believed Heathcliff\\'s tale that she was too sick to travel. Very early the next morning, however, Catherine came back by herself, joyful to hear that her father was still alive. She had convinced Linton to help her escape. Ellen asked her to tell Edgar that she would be content with Linton so that he could die happy, to which she agreed. Edgar died \\\\\"blissfully\\\\\". Catherine was stony-eyed with grief. Mr. Green, now employed by Heathcliff, gave all the servants but Ellen notice to quit, and hurried the funeral\", \"analysis\": \"This chapter reveals a level of cruelty in Heathcliff that has not been seen before. He has no reason to hate his son beyond the fact that he is a Linton, and yet he is perfectly willing to fill Linton\\'s last days with terror and despair. Linton\\'s life is singularly hopeless, and the mere fact that Bronte invented it testifies to the darkness of her vision. Linton is unlikable and dislikes everyone; he will die without ever achieving anything worthwhile or good, and probably without ever having been happy. A more pointless, bitter existence could hardly be imagined. In contrast, Heathcliff seems energetic and happy in this section of the novel, such that he seems to draw vitality from his son\\'s misery. This chapter provides further evidence of Linton\\'s bad character; he thinks exclusively of himself despite Cathy\\'s pain and terror. Cathy\\'s pity and kindness are the causes of her misfortunes here: in the presence of Heathcliff\\'s intelligent hatred, her good qualities only leave her vulnerable to his plans. One part of Heathcliff\\'s revenge fails: Cathy manages to escape in time to see her father again, and Edgar dies happy. Given the great importance attached to last words and dying moments, this is a notable victory for Cathy, and an essential one if all of Heathcliff\\'s evil work is to be undone in the end. If Edgar had died miserably, no amount of happy endings could ever have undone that tragedy. This chapter also includes some brief satire of lawyers; much as in modern society, many Victorians considered lawyers to be untrustworthy. Mr. Green\\'s willingness to be bought by the highest bidder demonstrates a moral bankruptcy that rivals Heathcliff\\'s. Heathcliff\\'s continued love for Catherine\\'s dead body after 18 years emphasizes the physical, yet non-physical nature of their relationship. It would appear to physical in a way that transcends conventional ideas about sexuality: Heathcliff was pleased to see that Catherine still looked like herself after 18 years, but claimed that if she had been \\\\\"dissolved into earth, or worse\\\\\"  he would have been no less comforted by the proximity to her body. His idea of heaven is to be utterly and completely unified with Catherine in body, as in spirit--and this could just as well mean to disintegrate into dust together as to be joined in the act of love. The difference between these two forms of union is that while people are joined during sexual intercourse, their separate bodies and identities remain clear. But in Heathcliff and Catherine\\'s corporeal and spiritual unity, as envisioned by him, an observer would not be able to tell \\\\\"which is which\\\\\"  This is similar to Catherine\\'s statement in Chapter 9 that she was Heathcliff. Some believe that difficult and painful experiences open the door to personal growth. If this is the case, Cathy\\'s short marriage to Linton should have caused her to grow a great deal from the happy and innocent girl she had formerly been. Instead, it appears to make her venomous and permanently angry. However, one might make the argument that the humbling she undergoes is necessary because, without it, she never would have bothered to see the good in Hareton. Is the time Cathy spends caring for Linton a complete loss, or does she learn anything valuable from it? This is related to the question of whether Wuthering Heights is a Christian novel: in Christian theology, suffering is usually considered ennobling. See the analysis of the next chapter for a discussion of the role of education and books in Cathy and Hareton\\'s relationship.\"}',\n",

Nelly searches through the house until she finds Linton, who tells her that Catherine is locked away in another room. The two are now husband and wife. Linton gloats over this development, claiming that all of Catherine\\'s possessions are now his, as Edgar is dying quickly. Fearing discovery by Heathcliff, Nelly hurries back to Thrushcross Grange. Here, she tells the dying Edgar that Catherine is safe and will soon be home. She sends a group of men to Wuthering Heights to retrieve Catherine, but they fail in their task.

Shortly after Edgar\\'s death, Mr. Green arrives, and dismisses all of the servants except Nelly. He tries to have Edgar buried in the chapel, but Nelly insists that he obey Edgar\\'s will, which states that he wishes to be buried in the churchyard next to his wife\", \"analysis\": \"As Edgar Linton grows weak and dies, Heathcliff\\'s cruelty rages unchecked. Without fear of repercussion, he abuses the other characters mercilessly, kidnapping Nelly and young Catherine. With no one left who is strong enough to counter Heathcliff, the course of events in these chapters seems inevitable. Heathcliff easily succeeds in marrying his son to young Catherine, and in inheriting Thrushcross Grange. However, a new force begins to rise up against the tyrant. Catherine shows a defiant spirit, and she triumphantly declares that the love between her and Linton will save them from misery and make them superior to Heathcliff. This foreshadows her eventual strong-willed rebellion against Heathcliff--and her redemption of her oppressed predecessors through her love for her other cousin, Hareton Earnshaw. The young Catherine\\'s manifestation of her mother\\'s boldness, as well as Heathcliff\\'s progressing revenge, bring to mind the older Catherine and the defiant marriage to Edgar with which she first sparked Heathcliff\\'s wrath. Indeed, perhaps because of young Catherine\\'s behavior, Heathcliff himself seems to become increasingly preoccupied with thoughts of the late Catherine. The horrifying spectacle of Heathcliff uncovering her grave and gazing upon her corpse\\'s face, as well as his intense concern about the fate of Catherine\\'s body, testifies to the extreme depth of his obsession. In a sense, Heathcliff\\'s interest in the decomposition of his beloved is quite in keeping with the nature of their relationship. The text consistently describes their love not only in spiritual terms, but in material ones. Thus Catherine declares in Chapter IX, \\\\\"Whatever souls are made of, his and mine are the same.\\\\\" Moreover, the relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine has come to be associated with the soil where it has been conducted; its fate becomes intertwined with that of the earth, as the narrative repeatedly links both Heathcliff and Catherine to the severe and wild moors, which frequently symbolize the unruly nature of their love. These chapters give us insight not only into the story\\'s main characters and their relationships, but also into the story\\'s narrator, Nelly Dean. First, Nelly chooses to lie to Edgar about his daughter\\'s condition as Edgar lingers near death, a well-meaning untruth that resembles her earlier lie to Linton, which she told en route to deliver him to Heathcliff. Just as she declared to Linton that his father was kind and generous, she now tells Edgar that his daughter is happily married. Nelly thus shows herself willing to lie and distort the truth in order to spare feelings and ease social situations. Nelly again displays a certain manipulative quality in a statement she makes outside the story, to Lockwood. She tells him that the young Catherine\\'s last hope for salvation would be a second marriage, but that she, Nelly, is powerless to bring about such a union. This remark seems intended to express more than idle wishfulness. As the reader may recall, Nelly insinuates in Chapter XXV that Lockwood might fall in love with Catherine himself. At the time, the comment seemed nothing more than speculation. Yet now the reader can see that Nelly may be pursuing a plot to rescue her former mistress. Indeed, Nelly\\'s willingness to narrate the story to Lockwood in the first place may stem from this notion of saving Catherine. Nelly paints a far more flattering picture of young Catherine than she does of the girl\\'s mother, even when they exhibit similar traits. Nelly frequently emphasizes young Catherine\\'s beauty, and she may subtly frame her story in a certain way so as to pique Lockwood\\'s interest in the girl. Of course, this is merely one possible interpretation of the text, but again, it is extremely important to consider the motivations and biases of the character who narrates the story. One of the most impressive aspects of Emily Bronte\\'s achievement in Wuthering Heights is her ability to include such finely drawn, subtle psychological portraits as that of Nelly Dean--many of whose most fascinating human qualities emerge only when one reads between the lines of her narration.\"}',\n",

The weather is cold, the ground is frozen, and his reception matches the bleak unfriendliness of the moors. After yelling at the old servant Joseph to open the door, he is finally let in by a peasant-like young man. The bare kitchen is warm, and Lockwood assumes that the young and beautiful girl there is Mrs. Heathcliff. He tries to make conversation but she is consistently scornful and inhospitable, and he only embarrasses himself. There is \\\\\"a kind of desperation\\\\\" in her eyes. She refuses to make him tea unless Heathcliff said he could have some. The young man and Heathcliff come in for tea. The young man behaves boorishly and seems to suspect Lockwood of making advances to the girl. Heathcliff demands tea \\\\\"savagely\\\\\" , and Lockwood decides he doesn\\'t really like him. Trying to make conversation again, Lockwood gets into trouble first assuming that the girl is Heathcliff\\'s wife, and then that she is married to the young man, who he supposes to be Heathcliff\\'s son. He is rudely corrected, and it transpires that the girl is Heathcliff\\'s daughter-in-law but her husband is dead, as is Heathcliff\\'s wife. The young man is Hareton Earnshaw. It is snowing hard and Lockwood requests a guide so he can return home safely, but he is refused: Heathcliff considers it more important that Hareton take care of the horses. Joseph, who is evidently a religious fanatic, argues with the girl, who frightens him by pretending to be a witch. The old servant doesn\\'t like her reading. Lockwood, left stranded and ignored by all, tries to take a lantern, but Joseph offensively accuses him of stealing it, and sets dogs on him. Lockwood is humiliated and Heathcliff and Hareton laugh. The cook, Zillah, takes him in and says he can spend the night\", \"analysis\": \"This chapter introduces the reader to the frame of the story: Lockwood will gradually discover the events which led to Heathcliff --now about forty years old--living with only his servants at Wuthering Heights, almost completely separated from society. Here, Heathcliff is characterized by casual violence and lack of concern for manners or consideration for other people. This is only a hint of the atmosphere of the whole novel, in which violence is contrasted with more genteel and civilized ways of living. Bronte begins to develop the natural setting of the novel by describing snowstorms and the moors, and it becomes clear that the bleak and harsh nature of the Yorkshire hills is not merely a geographical accident. It mirrors the roughness of those who live there: Wuthering Heights is firmly planted in its location and could not exist anywhere else. Knowing Emily Bronte\\'s passionate fondness for her homeland, we can expect the same bleakness which Lockwood finds so disagreeable to take on a wild beauty. Its danger cannot be forgotten, though: a stranger to those parts could easily lose his way and die of exposure. Heathcliff and the wind are similar in that they have no pity for weakness. The somewhat menacing presence of the natural world can also be seen in the large number of dogs who inhabit Wuthering Heights: they are not kept for pets. The power dynamics that Lockwood observes in the household of Wuthering Heights are extremely important. The girl is evidently frightened of Heathcliff and scornful of Hareton; Hareton behaves aggressively because he is sensitive about his status; Heathcliff does not hesitate to use his superior physical strength and impressive personality to bully other members of his household. The different ways in which different characters try to assert themselves reveal a lot about their situation. Most notably, it is evident that in this house, sheer force usually wins out over intellectual and humane pretensions. The girl is subversive and intellectual, an unwilling occupant of the house, but she can achieve little in the way of freedom or respect. Lockwood continues to lose face: his conversational grace appears ridiculous in this new setting. Talking to Heathcliff, for example, he refers to the girl as a \\\\\"beneficent fairy,\\\\\" which is evidently neither true nor welcome flattery. This chapter might be seen, then, as a continuation of the strict division between social ideals  and natural realities . If the chapter was taken by itself, out of context, the reader would see that while social ideals are ridiculed, it is clear that the cruel natural world is ugly and hardly bearable. However, these depictions will change and develop as the novel continues. It is very important that the ghost of Catherine Linton  appears as a child. Of course Lockwood thinks of her as a child, since he has just read parts of her childhood diary, but Heathcliff also seems to find it natural that she appeared in the form she had when they were children together. Rather than progressing from childhood on to a maturer age with its different values, Heathcliff and Catherine never really grew up. That is to say, the most emotionally important parts of their lives either took place in childhood or follows directly from commitments made then. They never outgrew their solidarity against the oppressive forces of adult authority and religion that is described in Catherine\\'s diary. Thus the ghost of Catherine Linton  tries to return to her childhood sanctuary, which Heathcliff has kept in its original state. This challenges the dominion of linear time. In this chapter, the narrative turns to the past: from now on, Lockwood will gradually lose importance as the story of Heathcliff and Catherine\\'s childhood becomes more and more vibrant. However, we cannot entirely neglect the role Ellen Dean plays as a narrator: her personality means that the events she recounts are presented in a unique style. She is practical and, like a good housekeeper, tends to incline to the side of order. Even when she was young, she did not really participate in the private lives of the children of Wuthering Heights, and has little access to the relationship of Heathcliff and Catherine. Bronte demonstrates her versatility by using different points of view, faithfully recording each character\\'s distinctive style of speech. Considering character development, it is interesting to know what Heathcliff and Catherine were like as children since, as we have seen in the previous chapter, their essential natures remain very much the same. Like her mother, Catherine Linton was willful and mischievous and Heathcliff was uncomplaining but vindictive. The extremely close and entirely sexless relationship between Heathcliff and Cathy already manifests itself in an opposition to the outside world of parental authority and religion. Cathy is already charming and manipulative, though her love for her father is real. Joseph\\'s false, oppressive religious convictions contrast with the pure, selfless thoughts of heaven of the grieving children. Earnshaw\\'s decline and death highlights the bond between the physical body and the spirit. The old man had formerly been charitable, loving, and open, but his physical weakness makes him irritable and peevish: the spirit is corrupted by the body\\'s decline. One might remember that Emily Bronte watched her brother Branwell die wretchedly of alcohol and drug abuse, having had his youthful dreams of gallantry and glory disappointed.\"}',\n",

In what is almost an aside, Joseph mentions the mother of Mrs. Heathcliff, claiming she went straight to the devil. Providing mostly exposition, the information is neither straightforward nor entirely explained, again creating a bit of mystery. Clearly these characters, who do not get along, let alone like one another, are somehow tied together. Introducing these characters to the reader is Lockwood, who again serves as narrator of these events, although Nelly, the unnamed housekeeper, serves as the primary narrator for the majority of the novel. Immediately, Lockwood\\'s reliability is again called into question. First of all, his decision to return to Wuthering Heights is itself questionable -- he is not invited, the weather is poor, and he is not sure of the way. Yet, after he arrives, he is annoyed that the inhabitants are being inhospitable. He has unrealistic expectations, which he presumes will be met. When Hareton leads him inside, Lockwood waits for the \\\\\"missis\\\\\" to ask him to be seated, which of course she does not do. Hareton orders him to be seated, and in an attempt to make polite conversation, Lockwood misidentifies a heap of rabbit pelts as pets and misidentifies the woman as Heathcliff\\'s wife. After being corrected by Heathcliff, Lockwood then mistakes Hareton as Heathcliff\\'s son. Lockwood\\'s inability to read people and situations make his narration suspect. In addition to the development of Lockwood\\'s character, important bits of information about other characters are revealed. Joseph, although fanatically religious, is also superstitious. Hareton is fiercely proud about his heritage. Mrs. Heathcliff is a paradoxical beauty who does not like being at Wuthering Heights but is not permitted to leave. And Heathcliff has lost both a wife and a son. At this point in time, these characters are intriguing but not sympathetic.

He knocks, but no one lets him in, and Joseph, an old servant who speaks with a thick Yorkshire accent, calls out from the barn that Heathcliff is not in the house. Eventually a rough-looking young man comes to let him in, and Lockwood goes into a sitting room where he finds a beautiful girl seated beside a fire. Lockwood assumes she is Heathcliff\\'s wife. He tries to make conversation, but she responds rudely. When Heathcliff arrives, he corrects Lockwood: the young woman is his daughter-in-law. Lockwood then assumes that the young man who let him in must be Heathcliff\\'s son. Heathcliff corrects him again. The young man, Hareton Earnshaw, is not his son, and the girl is the widow of Heathcliff\\'s dead son. The snowfall becomes a blizzard, and when Lockwood is ready to leave, he is forced to ask for a guide back to Thrushcross Grange. No one will help him. He takes a lantern and says that he will find his own way, promising to return with the lantern in the morning. Joseph, seeing him make his way through the snow, assumes that he is stealing the lantern, and looses the dogs on him. Pinned down by the dogs, Lockwood grows furious, and begins cursing the inhabitants of the house. His anger brings on a nosebleed, and he is forced to stay at Wuthering Heights. The housekeeper, Zillah, leads him to bed\", \"analysis\": \"The strange, deliberately confusing opening chapters of Wuthering Heights serve as Bronte\\'s introduction to the world of the novel and to the complex relationships among the characters, as well as to the peculiar style of narration through which the story will be told. One of the most important aspects of the novel is its second- and third-hand manner of narration. Nothing is ever related simply from the perspective of a single participant. Instead, the story is told through entries in Lockwood\\'s diary, but Lockwood does not participate in the events he records. The vast majority of the novel represents Lockwood\\'s written recollections of what he has learned from the testaments of others, whether he is transcribing what he recalls of Catherine\\'s diary entry or recording his conversations with Nelly Dean. Because of the distance that this imposes between the reader and the story itself, it is extremely important to remember that nothing in the book is written from the perspective of an unbiased narrator, and it is often necessary to read between the lines in order to understand events. The reader can immediately question Lockwood\\'s reliability as a conveyer of facts. A vain and somewhat shallow man, he frequently makes amusing mistakes--he assumes, for instance, that Heathcliff is a gentleman with a house full of servants, even though it is apparent to the reader that Heathcliff is a rough and cruel man with a house full of dogs. Nelly Dean is more knowledgeable about events, as she has participated in many of them first hand, yet while this makes her more trustworthy in some ways, it also makes her more biased in others. She frequently glosses over her own role in the story\\'s developments, particularly when she has behaved badly. Later in the novel, she describes how she took the young Linton to live with his cruel father after the death of his mother. She lies to the boy on the journey, telling him that his father is a kind man, and, after his horrible meeting with Heathcliff, she tries to sneak out when he is not paying attention. He notices her and begs her not to leave him with Heathcliff. She ignores his entreaties, however, and tells Lockwood that she simply had \\\\\"no excuse for lingering longer.\\\\\" Nelly is generally a dependable source of information, but moments such as this one--and there are many--remind the reader that the story is told by a fallible human being. Apart from establishing the manner and quality of narration, the most important function of these early chapters is to pique the reader\\'s curiosity about the strange histories of the denizens of Wuthering Heights. The family relationships, including multiple Earnshaws, Catherines, Lintons, and Heathcliffs, seem at this point in the novel to intertwine with baffling complexity, and the characters, because Lockwood first encounters them late in their story, seem full of mysterious passions and ancient, hidden resentments. Even the setting of this history seems to possess its own secrets. Wild and desolate, full of eerie winds and forgotten corners, the land has borne witness to its residents\\' nighttime walks, forbidden meetings, and graveyard visits. Indeed, the mysteries of the land cannot be separated from the mysteries of the characters, and the physical landscape of the novel is often used to reflect the mental and emotional landscapes of those who live there. While the odd characters and wild setting contribute to a certain sense of mystery, this sense is most definitively established by the appearance of Catherine Earnshaw\\'s ghost. Yet while Lockwood\\'s account of the event greatly influences the feel of the novel, and while his subsequent account of it to Heathcliff provokes a reaction that may offer us clues as to his relationship with the late Catherine, the reader may still conclude that the ghost is a figment of Lockwood\\'s imagination. Because Lockwood has proven himself flighty and emotional, and he is still half asleep when he encounters the ghost, one could infer that he never actually sees a ghost, but simply has an intense vision in the midst of his dream. It seems likely, however, that Emily Bronte would have intended the ghost to seem real to her readers: such a supernatural phenomenon would certainly be in keeping with the Gothic tone pervading the rest of the novel. Moreover, Heathcliff refers to Catherine\\'s ghost several times during the course of the novel. Clearly he concurs with Lockwood in believing that she haunts Wuthering Heights. Thus the ghost, whether objectively \\\\\"real\\\\\" or not, attests to the way the characters remain haunted by a troubling and turbulent past.\"}',\n",

It is a misty and cold afternoon as he makes his way through four miles of mud to the house of his landlord. When he knocks at the door, he hears the howling of dogs. Joseph shoves his head through a window in the barn and tells Lockwood that only the \\\\\"missis\\\\\" is at home and that she will not answer his summons. A young man with a pitchfork leads Lockwood in through the back door. Lockwood wonders who he is. Once inside, he sees a motionless and nearly silent young woman sitting in the room; she apparently is the \\\\\"missis.\\\\\" Lockwood is immediately attracted to her. Heathcliff soon comes in and grimly informs Lockwood that he should not have come, for he is likely to lose his way as he returns home in the snowstorm. Lockwood, who has wrongly assumed that the young woman is Heathcliff\\'s wife, is informed that the girl was married to Heathcliff\\'s son, who is now dead. The young man who showed him to into the house is Hareton Earnshaw. Relations between these family members seem surprisingly strained, almost hostile. After a short visit, Lockwood requests help in returning home, but he is refused. As the storm still continues, Lockwood appeals to the young woman for assistance. She informs him that she is forbidden to leave the property. As a result, it appears he must stay over at Wuthering Heights. From the kitchen entrance, Heathcliff tells him that there is no room for guests. If he stay, he must stay with Hareton or Joseph. Exasperated and angry, Lockwood utters an expression of disgust and rushes out to the yard. However, the dogs attack Lockwood, and his nose begins to bleed. He is forced to spend the night at the Heights.\", \"analysis\": \"Notes This chapter is remarkable for the light it throws on the Heathcliff household and its members. Lockwood is puzzled at the animosity these people display towards one other. Nelly Dean, the housekeeper at Thrushcross Grange and the principal narrator of the novel, is introduced; however, her name is not given at this point. Two new characters are presented. One of them is Mrs. Heathcliff, the widow of the son of Heathcliff. She is a slender young woman with golden hair fixed in ringlets. She has an excellent figure and a lovely face although Lockwood notices an unnatural scorn and a desperation in her eyes. She discourages all his attempts at conversation and gruffly refuses his request for help in getting back to the Grange. There seems to be a childishness and vindictiveness in her. These traits are particularly revealed in her behavior with Joseph. She threatens him with witchcraft until the servant trembles with \\\\\"sincere horror.\\\\\" On the whole, she is inconsiderate, rude and unfriendly, but no explanation is yet give for this behavior. Another new character is a young man called Hareton Earnshaw. He is poorly dressed, and his speech is crass. Since no explanation is given as to his relation to Heathcliff, Lockwood cannot decide if Hareton is a servant or not. He notices that the young man\\'s thick, brown curls are \\\\\"rough and uncultivated,\\\\\" and his hands are like those of a laborer. His manner, however, is confident to the point of arrogance. Lockwood also observes that the young man does not behave like a servant while attending to the lady of the house. Although Lockwood notices that it is his name that is engraved at the entrance of Wuthering Heights, Hareton\\'s relationship to the family is still a mystery. More is also learned about the main character in this chapter. The reader learns that Heathcliff is a man of about forty. The chapter also reinforces his unsociable behavior. When Heathcliff finds him in the house, Lockwood receives a cold reception and is told he should not have come because of the snowstorm. Heathcliff also forbids Hareton from guiding Lockwood back to the Grange. Most importantly, the chapter reveals that Heathcliff seems to have a real hatred towards his daughter-in-law and forbids her to leave Wuthering Heights for any reason. This information forces Lockwood to change his good opinion about his landlord. To reinforce his negative thoughts, Lockwood is shocked when Heathcliff and Hareton laugh instead of rescuing him when he is attacked by the dogs. Lockwood decides that Heathcliff has a genuinely bad nature. The servant Joseph is also presented in the chapter. His dialect adds local color to the novel, and many of the words he uses need translation: t\\'fowwld , t\\'laith , nobbut , flaysome dins , neight , and nowt . His animosity toward Lockwood and his treatment of the young \\\\\"missis\\\\\" are very strange indeed. When Mrs. Heathcliff threatens to use witchcraft on him, he is easily terrified. The only rational and kind person in the house seems to be Zillah. She rushes to save Lockwood when he is attacked by the dogs. Overall, the chapter is a bleak one that presents a very negative picture of the inhabitants of Wuthering Heights, especially Heathcliff. The cold, snowy weather heightens the overall bleakness and seems to conspire against Lockwood.\"}',\n",

Lockwood says that he means his wife, and Heathcliff tells him that she is dead. Lockwood then notices the differences between the ages of Heathcliff and the young woman, and then assumes that she is the wife of the shabby, rude, young man. He thinks that Heathcliff is corroborating his assumption when he says that she is his daughter-in-law , but when he turns to the young man saying that she must be his wife, all are angry, and Heathcliff says that neither are married to her, and that the young man is not his son, but Hareton Earnshaw. Lockwood feels quite out of place and everyone is quite dismal. Lockwood tries to figure out how he will get home, but no one will help him, and finally Heathcliff tells him that he can sleep with Earnshaw or Joseph, as Heathcliff does not trust him to run about the house while he is sleeping. Lockwood is insulted and tries to leave the house, running into Hareton. They all fight about what to do with him. Lockwood can take no more, but when he runs and grabs a lantern and starts to run away saying that he will send it back the next day, Joseph yells that he is stealing and sets the dogs after him.

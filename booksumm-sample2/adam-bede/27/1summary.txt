It's now \"beyond the middle of August--nearly three weeks after the birthday feast\" . Confetti's been swept up, dizziness has been slept off, and yet the weather is still beautiful as can be. When this chapter opens, even the wind \"seemed only part of the general gladness because the sun was shining\" . Imagine what it's like to be a Hayslope weatherman: \"Today, absolutely beautiful. And tomorrow, also beautiful.\" Adam's had a busy day. He's got new responsibilities, and he's still working at his old job with Mr. Burge. He's not seen Hetty nearly enough. So he resolves to \"make leisure for going to the Farm\" . So, while the sun sets, well-worked Adam trudges across Hayslope--thinking affectionately about Hetty and Arthur and the rest of his ever-improving life. Then he enters a lush stretch of forest. And his life takes a turn for the worse. He sees two people embracing and kissing in the distance. Arthur. And Hetty. Once the kissing and embracing is done, Hetty heads off and Arthur walks right in Adam's direction. He tells Adam that he was just seeing Hetty home and simply \"asked for a kiss for my pains\" . Sure... Adam, meanwhile, is both deeply hurt and completely flabbergasted. And when Arthur tries to walk away as though nothing has happened, Adam becomes furious. He accuses Arthur of \"acting the part of a selfish light-minded scoundrel\" . Arthur realizes that Adam loves Hetty, and realizes that he's come between them. Arthur is sorry for the mess he's caused. Yet Adam doesn't give him much time to repent. Instead, he challenges Arthur to a fistfight, then and there. Arthur is a good fighter, but \"between unarmed men the battle is to the strong\" . That would be Adam. With a single well-placed blow he knocks Arthur out--and at once feels remorse. And the chapter ends, with Adam kneeling over Arthur's unmoving body \"like an image of despair gazing at an image of death\" .", "analysis": ""}

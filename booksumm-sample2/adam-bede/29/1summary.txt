When Arthur wakes up, his first thoughts have to do with Adam. Arthur's a generous guy, the type who likes \"to make all offenses forgotten in benefits\" . But he realizes how profoundly he has hurt Adam, and realizes that he'll have to hurt Hetty, too, before the novel's done. If only he could give them all some money and make the conflict go away. As Arthur thinks about writing the letter, his feelings are divided. The letter seems \"at one moment to be a gross barbarity, at another perhaps the greatest kindness\" . Arthur goes for a ride, but even this can't take his mind of the dilemma. He turns home and rides like mad, knowing he has to write the blasted letter one way or another. In no time at all the letter is written, sealed, and in Adam's hand. Heartbreaking letters are like band-aids; get 'em off quick and they'll hurt a whole lot less.", "analysis": ""}

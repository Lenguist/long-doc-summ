He hates to witness pain. Once he gave a gardener his favorite pencil case because he kicked over the man's supper of broth. If Arthur could gain back Adam's self-confidence with gifts, then he would try to do so, but he knows that he cannot. He also feels bad for Hetty, who, upon learning that he was going away, asked if she could come as his wife. He resolves to make everything up to her with future benefits. He takes a ride on his horse to try to ascertain whether he should write the letter after all, because in his room he is having the mad thought of carrying her away. Once on horseback, he decides to write it after all. When Adam arrives at five, the butler gives him a letter addressed to Adam. He opens it, and enclosed is a letter to Hetty. Arthur wrote that this is what Adam wanted, and he has left to Adam the decision whether to give the letter to Hetty or not. Adam hesitates. He decides to feel out what sort of state of mind Hetty is in before giving her the letter", "analysis": "The first chapter of Book Fourth is crucial. Matters come to a head in Chapter Twenty-Seven when Adam finds out Arthur's and Hetty's secret.  Moreover, despite the fact that they are isolated in the woods, class differences come to bear on the friendship between Arthur and Adam once again.  When Arthur at first refuses to fight Adam, Adam worries that Arthur thinks that he does not have to pay for the wrong that he has done to Adam because he is of a nobler rank.  When the two men do fight, the fact that Adam is a laborer gives him the decisive advantage in strength against Arthur, against whom he is in other respects well-matched. Class would also become an issue if, as Adam suspects, Arthur dies.  To kill any man would be a large problem in their small community, but to kill the only heir of his landlord would be a crisis for Adam Bede. There is a decided role reversal in terms of class structure in Chapter Twenty-Eight.  In previous parts of the book, Adam was all too glad to shake Arthur's hand, especially because the Captain did not deign to shake the hands of his other tenants.  Now, however, Adam is in the moral right in this chapter, and he thus is in a position to refuse his social superior's condescension. Eliot illustrates her contention that even in their society, it is not the social hierarchy but the moral hierarchy that matters after all.  Arthur is sufficiently penitent to realize that he has made a particularly damaging mistake, so he will agree to whatever Adam asks him to do as a result of the mistake, despite the fact that the social order dictates that it is he who should be telling Adam what to do, not the other way around. In Chapter Twenty-Nine, Eliot uses the common literary device of a misplaced or misdirected letter. This device is famous in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and has long roots in literature.  In Shakespeare's play, both lovers die because of the crucial misplacement of a letter.  It is not a good sign, therefore, that Adam is second-guessing whether he should deliver the letter or not. When a communication goes awry, terrible results can ensue. Arthur's character is looking still less appealing in this chapter. He cannot face reproaches to himself comfortably.  He tries to place some of the blame on Adam, and he ends up placing the burden of whether to hurt Hetty by giving her the letter or not also squarely on Adam's shoulders.  This is unfair because it puts two of Adam's best characteristics in opposition to one another: his love of truth, and his desire to protect those whom he loves. Chapter Thirty reminds readers that besides the socioeconomic aspects of marriage, there is a stricly social aspect to it as well.  The Bede boys need not  think only of whether a potential marriage partner is within their socio-economic reach, but also they must consider who will fit well in their existing family. While class plays a role in social acceptance, it is important that their future wives will get along with their mother in more fundamental ways, because they all will live in the same house together. Hetty is the only character in the novel who does not seem to be old enough or perceptive enough to understand the obvious workings of the class structure in her society.  In Chapter Thirty-One, she thinks that Arthur is being cruel in refusing to marry her, rather than pragmatic.  She is also not wise enough to know that whatever choices she will make now will continue to affect her for a very long time.  She is desperately unhappy, so she wants a change quickly, but she does not understand that a choice to run away, to become a lady's maid, or to marry Adam will have far-reaching, perhaps lifelong, effects. By Chapter Thirty-Two, Mrs. Poyser has been planning her diatribe against the old Squire for a long time, but she has never been able to muster the courage to tell him what she thinks until this very moment.  She is incensed by his arbitrary use of his powers over the family, and she is sufficiently angry to cross class lines in venting this anger. Eliot engages an interesting point of view about privacy in this novel.  Adam Bede focuses so much on the community that it does not seem that any feeling or action can remain private for very long.  Hetty's locket bursts out of her dress, where she tried to keep it secret, just as the words burst out of Mrs. Poyser's mouth.  Mrs. Poyser thinks that it is unhealthy to avoid giving vent to her feelings.  This strong community and lack of privacy has also been reflected in Adam's assumption that Hetty could have no lover he did not know about because she scarcely ever leaves the farm and because he knows all of her acquaintances. By Chapter Thirty-Three, Adam's life, which has been rather hard throughout the course of the novel, finally begins to look easier.  Eliot interposes her own voice yet again in defense of Adam's sentimentality in continuing to love Hetty despite what she has done in the past.  Eliot claims that it is a positive feature of Adam's personality that he can be played upon by Hetty's delicate beauty; this virtue seems to correspond to Adam's artistic, rather than his peasant qualities. Recall that Eliot ditinguished such qualities in a previous chapter.  The fact that Hetty's outer beauty does not correspond to her inner beauty is something that Eliot seems to propose that Adam has no way of knowing, although one ought to be able to infer moral beauty from one's external words and actions. Adam's inability to see Hetty's flaws clearly is likely to give him great trouble in the future. Chapter Thirty-Four contains a great deal of dramatic irony, a literary device in which readers have more knowledge about a situation than the characters themselves and can appreciate seeing the drama play itself out.  Adam is extremely happy with his engagement, little knowing, as the reader does, that he is completely misinterpreting Hetty's feelings.  His misunderstanding seems to work out for the best however, because it emboldens Adam to ask Hetty to marry him, something that the entire novel has led up to. Hetty's suicidal thoughts at the pond, in Chapter Thirty-Five, recall the suicidal attempt of another famous literary heroine from the 18th century: Richardson's Pamela.  In Richardson's novel, he depicts the struggles of a virtuous servant girl to fend off the sexual attempts of her handsome gentleman master.  The aristocrat kidnaps the young girl, shutting her up in a country estate.  Rather than give in to his advances, the young heroine attempts to drown herself in a small pond on the estate, but her religious convictions are too strong to allow her to do so.  It is the knowledge of this suicide attempt which reforms the master, making him repent of his advances to her.  Eventually the two marry and are quite happy, despite their difference in class. Henry Fielding published a satirical response to Pamela , called Shamela .  Purportedly told from Pamela's own point of view, it is the tale of how a sexually voracious servant girl entraps her master by acting innocent.  The episode of the suicide is a cleverly engineered prank on Shamela's part, designed to make her master think that she has religious sentiments. Hetty's suicidal attempts lie strangely between these two extremes.  Unlike Pamela, she has not fended off the sexual attempts of her social superior with the greatest of success.  As will be shown by her later contemplation of suicide, it is not religious sentiments that keep her from taking the plunge.  Still, she is not at the extreme of Shamela; she has no sexual relationship with other members of the small town, and she does not think that a mock suicide on her part would bring Arthur running back to her side."}

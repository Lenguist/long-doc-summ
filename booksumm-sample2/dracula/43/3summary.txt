All the men agree to help her loathing the sight of the creature. The next night, they enter the tomb and put a stake on the creature and kill it.", "analysis": "Notes The most crucifixes are all signs of the deep-rooted Christianity prevalent in England at that time. They were said to be so powerful that they would destroy all evil in the world. Lucy has evidently become a thing in the clan of the Un-dead, and the very men who were in love with her hate her. They all help in killing the thing. The band is being formed slowly. In this chapter a group of four, of Dr. Seward, Van Helsing, Arthur Holmwood and Quincey Morris are present."}

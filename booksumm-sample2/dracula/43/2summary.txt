{"name": "Chapter XVI", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210120133206/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/dracula/section7/", "summary": "That night, the four men go to Lucy's grave and find it empty. Van Helsing seals the door of the tomb with Communion wafers to prevent the vampire Lucy from reentering. The men then hide in wait. Eventually, a figure appears, dressed entirely in white and carrying a child. It is Lucy--or rather, a monster that looks like Lucy, with eyes \"unclean and full of hell-fire\" and a mouth stained with fresh blood. As the men surround her, she drops the child and calls out passionately to Holmwood, telling him to come to her. Holmwood begins to move, but Van Helsing leaps between the couple and brandishes a crucifix. Lucy recoils. Van Helsing quickly removes the Communion wafers, and the vampire slips through the door of her tomb. Having witnessed this horror, Holmwood concurs that the necessary rites must be performed, and the following evening, he returns to hammer a stake through Lucy's heart. As Lucy returns to a state of beauty, Van Helsing reassures Holmwood that he has saved Lucy's soul from eternal darkness and has given her peace at last. Before leaving the tomb, Van Helsing makes plans to reunite with the men two nights later, so that they may discuss the \"terrible task\" before them", "analysis": "In this section, Lucy's transformation reaches its terrible end. Lucy is now a perversion of the two most sacred female virtues in Victorian England: maternalism and sexual purity. In Chapter XVII, Mina voices an expectation of Victorian culture when she writes, \"We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked.\" Like the three women Harker meets in Dracula's castle, the undead Lucy counters this \"mother-spirit\" by preying on innocent children. Rather than providing them with nourishment and protection, she stalks and feeds on them. The hideous transformation of this once beautiful woman into a demonic child-killer demonstrates the anxiety the Victorians felt about women whose sexual behavior challenged convention. Van Helsing's band of do-gooders feels this same anxiety about female sexuality as they face off against its hypersexualized opponent. As the men confront Lucy, whose purity has changed to \"voluptuous wantonness,\" we note the rather limited vocabulary Stoker uses to paint the scene. Lucy is described almost exclusively in terms of her sexuality: her face becomes \"wreathed with a voluptuous smile,\" and she advances with \"outstretched arms and a wanton smile.\" Lucy's words to Holmwood echo her dying wish for his kiss: \"Come to me, Arthur. . . . My arms are hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!\" Her words are both a plea for and a promise of sexual satisfaction. Van Helsing and his crew's response to Lucy's words illustrate that the men are certainly aware of the words' double meaning. The men are equally attracted to and horrified by the woman who would make such a bold proposition: \"There was something diabolically sweet in her tones . . . which rang through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms.\" Dracula's power is indeed considerable, as it tempts even morally righteous men who are aware of the count's diabolical plans. Tempted as the men are by Lucy's carnal embrace, they are equally eager to destroy her. Throughout the descriptions of Lucy's voluptuousness runs a strong indication of the men's desire to annihilate her. Dr. Seward writes, \"he remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have done it with savage delight.\" Having paid for sexual curiosity with her eternal soul, Lucy must now pay an equally steep price for her sexual appetite. The act of Lucy's final destruction strongly resembles an act of sexual congress. Holmwood's piercing of Lucy with his stake unmistakably suggests intercourse: her body \"shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions. . . . But Arthur never faltered . . . driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake.\" Holmwood's attack restores Lucy's purity and soul, thus implying that Holmwood returns Lucy to the socially desirable state of monogamy and submission. As her fiance, Holmwood cleanses the \"carnal and unspiritual\" from Lucy by consummating a sexual relationship that, without Dracula's interference, would have not only been consecrated by God, but also would have legitimized Lucy's troublesome sexual desires."}

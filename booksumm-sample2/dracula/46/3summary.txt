The whole place is covered with dust and spiders. There is a faint bad odor. They find 29 boxes out of the 50 sent by Dracula. Suddenly, the whole place is filled with rats. Arthur whistles for his dogs and the rats disperse. They return back to the asylum. Mina complains of feeling tired. Mina writes in her journal of strange dreams of a red-eyed white face. She is restless and cant sleep well.", "analysis": "Notes Dracula has claimed another of the woman of the band of Mina Harker. In this chapter, it is not clear if the reader recalls that she suffers from the same symptoms as Lucy. In the meantime, the band has achieved success on one count. They have managed to seal off the house of Dracula with the sacred wafer."}

This hiding-place has enabled Cluny to escape the detection of King George's soldiers and has meant that unlike other defeated Jacobite clan leaders, he has not been forced into exile in France. He greets Alan and David warmly, and raises a toast to a restored Stuart monarch. Cluny has lived in seclusion for so long that he has developed odd habits. He still acts as chief of his clan, solving disputes that are brought to him in his hideaway. Cluny entertains Alan and David with tales of how he hosted Charles Stewart , the Stewart claimant to the throne of England, in his tree-house. After dinner, Cluny invites Alan and David to play cards, but David declines. His Protestant Whig upbringing has taught him that gambling at cards is immoral, though he is careful not to say this explicitly. Cluny, however, takes offense. Alan excuses David by saying he is tired and should go to bed, and Cluny rather reluctantly allows him to do so. David, who is ill with a fever, slips into a delirious sleep. On their second day at Cluny's, Alan wakes David and asks to borrow some money. Hardly in possession of his senses, David hands over all his money. David wakes on the third day and is shocked to find that Alan has gambled away all their money. Cluny indignantly insists that he would never keep the money, but Alan is too proud to ask for it back. David takes Cluny outside and politely points out that he also feels too proud to ask for money that Cluny won fairly from Alan. David tells Cluny: \"this gambling is a very poor employ for gentlefolks. David is sure that Cluny hates him, but Cluny hands over the money and shakes David's hand", "analysis": ""}

David looks for Mr. Rankeillor and runs into him by accident. Mr. Rankeillor invites him into his house, and David tells him his story, though he is worried at the thought that he is Ebenezer's employee. Mr. Rankeillor says that he was, but no longer. On the day that David was shipwrecked, Mr. Campbell had come to his office, demanding to know where David was. Ebenezer then arrived. He claimed that he had given David a great deal of money and that David had left for continental Europe, wanting to break with his past life. Mr. Rankeillor and Mr. Campbell had not believed Ebenezer. Then Hoseason had arrived with the story that David had drowned in the shipwreck. David tells more of his story. When he mentions Alan's name, Mr. Rankeillor, who has heard of Alan as the chief suspect in the Appin murder, pretends he has not heard, and names Alan Mr. Thomson. That way, if Mr. Rankeillor is later questioned about Alan in court, he can claim that he knows nothing about him. Similarly, Colin Campbell is renamed Mr. Glen, James of the Glens is referred to as Mr. Thomson's relative, and Cluny Macpherson is renamed Mr. Jameson. After David finishes his story, Mr. Rankeillor gives David some fresh clothes", "analysis": ""}

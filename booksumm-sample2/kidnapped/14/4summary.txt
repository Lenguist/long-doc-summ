{"name": "Chapter XIV", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210511071637/https://www.novelguide.com/kidnapped/summaries/chapter13-18", "summary": "David finds that he is stranded on a small barren island, separated from the mainland by a creek that is too deep to wade across. He cannot swim and the piece of wood he used to bring him to the shore has drifted away, so he cannot use it to float across. The only food he can find is shellfish, which sometimes make him very sick and at other times seem to agree with him. David is miserable, lonely, and increasingly weak. He has lost most of his money in the shipwreck. He can see a distant church and houses on the mainland, but cannot see a way of reaching them. On David's third day on the island, some fishermen sail their boat near him. He calls to them, but they only shout in Gaelic, laugh, and pass on. David cannot believe their cruelty. The next day, he sees the same boat again, but this time, it sails directly to the island. One of the men tells him in broken English that when the tide is out, he can wade across the creek to the mainland. David feels embarrassed that he did not realize this. He recognizes that the fishermen were not being cruel when they previously laughed at him, as they could not know that he did not understand how to get to the mainland", "analysis": ""}

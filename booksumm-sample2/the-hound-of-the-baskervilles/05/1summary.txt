Holmes says that the other people staying at the hotel cannot be connected to the person watching Sir Henry, because that person is keeping his distance. When they arrive at Sir Henry's room, they find out that he is furious. Someone's stolen an old black boot, leaving him a mismatched pair of one brown and one black. Sir Henry apologizes for making such a fuss over such a small thing as two stolen boots. But Holmes looks Very Serious--clearly, this Mystery of the Stolen Boots means a lot more to Holmes than it does to us. Holmes asks if Sir Henry knows anyone with a thick black beard. Yep--apparently Barrymore, the butler at Baskerville Hall, fits that description. It turns out that both Barrymore and his wife received money in Sir Charles' will. Perhaps they could be the culprits! Dr. Mortimer admits that he also received some cash from Sir Charles' will. But the rest of his estate all went to Sir Henry: 740,000 pounds, to be exact. . The real Holmes gives John Clayton some money and then laughs with Watson. He realizes that the spy must have recognized Holmes when he started following Sir Henry.", "analysis": ""}

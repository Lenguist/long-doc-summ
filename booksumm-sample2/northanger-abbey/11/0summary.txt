{"name": "Chapter XI", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210622234141/https://www.gradesaver.com/northanger-abbey/study-guide/summary-volume-i-chapters-ix-xii", "summary": "On the morning that she is scheduled to go for a walk in the countryside with the Tilney, Catherine is dismayed to wake up to a cloudy day. It begins to rain as Catherine watches through the window. The walk is scheduled for twelve o'clock, and Catherine waits for the Tilneys until half past twelve. She is summoned to go for a carriage ride with John, Isabella, and James. At first she refuses to go, but John tells her that he just saw Henry and Miss Tilney driving away from Bath in a carriage. Catherine agrees to go with John. As soon as they head out, Catherine sees Henry and Miss Tilney walking down the street. Catherine implores John to stop the carriage, but he only goes faster. Catherine consoles herself with the prospects of seeing Blaize Castle, a country house, and she imagines that it will meet her expectations of encountering a Gothic castle with \"winding vaults\" and a \"low, grating door. However, the traveling party have set out too late to reach their destination, and Catherine feels let down for a second time that day. The rest of the ride is spoiled for Catherine. When she comes home to the Allens, the footman reveals that the Tilneys called for her just minutes after she departed. Isabella makes light of Catherine's distress that night when they gather at the Thorpes to play cards", "analysis": "Austen establishes two sets of parallel relationships in Chapters IX and X. The flirtation between Isabella and James intensifies, as made apparent by Isabella's coy comments to Catherine at the theater. While Isabella insists that she is glad Catherine was not there to tease her and James about their shared opinions during the carriage ride, we may infer that Isabella enjoys testing Catherine's reactions just as much as she enjoys flirting with her brother. As a younger and more inexperienced woman, Catherine serves as Isabella's ideal audience in the theater of desire that masquerades as polite society. Although Isabella privileges the notion of privacy here, she is much more concerned with gaining a reputation as a public success, whether it is as the most beautiful girl at the ball or as the object of James' attention. On his end, James seems just as infatuated with Isabella as she is with him, although he is less concerned with the propriety of his actions--this is why is he unafraid to ask Isabella to dance past the two-dance limit and potentially set off rumors of their growing attachment. In contrast, Catherine comes to find John's company suffocating. John's character is boisterous, loud, and self-aggrandizing, and his obsession with horses makes the carriage ride an exercise in patience for Catherine. Catherine's thoughts are constantly diverted by the dawning knowledge that John's vanity leads him to make \"idle assertions and impudent falsehoods.\" For a girl who has seen so little of the world up until now, this is a rather shocking realization. It is no wonder that Catherine is eager to be distracted by news of the Tilney family. After the carriage ride, Mrs. Allen's revelation to Catherine that Mrs. Tilney is dead is an instance of foreshadowing: the second part of the novel will deal substantially with Catherine's quest to determine the cause of Mrs. Tilney's death. For now, Catherine's acquaintance with the Tilney family is still in its first stages. Catherine's desire to become friends with Miss Tilney mirrors Isabella's desire to become friends with Catherine, but with a crucial difference. While Isabella wants to use Catherine as a means to reach James, we may infer that Catherine wants to be friends with Miss Tilney for her own sake. Nonetheless, Miss Tilney provides Catherine with crucial information regarding Henry's plans to attend the cotillion ball. In Chapter 10, Henry's extended metaphor comparing a dance to a marriage is an example of his verbal wit. Much like a marriage, Henry says, in a marriage \"fidelity and complaisance\" are the \"principal duties\": both men and women must be faithful to the partners they have chosen and not covet the partners of others. However, men have the \"advantage\" of choosing their partners in both a dance and a marriage, while women only have the \"power of refusal.\" While Catherine dismisses the validity of the comparison, she is struck by the force of Henry's comparison. Unlike her one-sided conversation with John, Catherine's exchange with Henry shows us that she is unafraid to speak her mind in the presence of good company. Catherine's readerly imagination is ignited by the mention of Blaize Castle during her second carriage ride with John. She invests the image of the castle with the preconceptions she has gained from reading Radcliffe's Gothic novel: \"the delight of exploring an edifice like Udolpho, as her fancy represented Blaize Castle to be, was such a counterpoise of good, as might console her for almost anything.\" However, Catherine's romantic associations with the unseen house are thwarted when they turn back early, and her desire to indulge in a Gothic fantasy does not truly manifest itself until later in the novel, when she visits the Tilney estate. Thus, the failed carriage ride to Blaize Castle is a preparatory episode that spells out Catherine's wish to match her reality to the books she has read, namely Radcliffe's novel. Isabella's friendship with Catherine has visibly cooled by the closing scene of Chapter XI. Isabella is insensitive to Catherine's plight about the Tilneys. Catherine could \"almost have accused Isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her sorrows.\" Isabella's hypocrisy is also apparent to the reader when she berates the Tilneys for failing to appear on time. She tells Catherine that \"I never mind going through anything, where a friend is concerned,\" but we already know that she is out to serve her own selfish interests. In Chapter XII, Catherine's perception that Henry looked angry with her at the theater leads us to believe that he has feelings for her . This is an insight that Catherine does not yet share. Her tone of searching wonder is \"thoroughly artless:\" unlike Isabella, Catherine does not know how to construct phrases with a double meaning. Her innocence and lack of guile contrasts sharply with Isabella's coy behavior."}

{"name": "chapter 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang24.html", "summary": "White Fangs experiences at Sierra Vista, Scotts residence, are described in this chapter. Scotts family is also introduced. Dick, the deeerhound, has accepted White Fang, and they do fine together; but White Fang tries to avoid Collie, who still tries to stand in his way. White Fang also learns to like Weedon and Maud, Scotts children, and to accept the servants. It is difficult for White Fang to adjust to Sierra Vista and learn the rules he must follow. Once, he kills fifty chickens before he learns that their coop is off-limits. Scott works with White Fang, trying to train him for life in the California countryside. He uses his voice, not violence, to control White Fang, who responds positively and learns quickly. Even Judge Scott is forced to admit that White Fang is smart. Before long, White Fang has learned to spare domesticated animals, such as the chickens, and to pursue only wild animals, like jack rabbits. There are three dogs in town who perpetually trouble White Fang. Since he is not allowed to fight them, he tries to stay away. One day he is permitted to pursue these dogs, and he kills them all. The reader is suddenly reminded of White Fangs wild origins and recent history. It is miraculous that Scott has been able to bring this wolf under control.", "analysis": ""}

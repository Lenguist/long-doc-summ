He learns the nature of the Indians and their sense of justice and power. He learns to avoid the mothers of half-grown puppies, due to a few bad experiences with them. He still fights with Lip-lip and is defeated every time. Once, he lures Lip-lip towards Kiche, who, although tied, leaps upon him and injures him badly. White Fang, too, sinks his teeth into Lip-lips hind leg. Kiche is released by Gray Beaver. Mother and son are now together, much to Lip-lips disappointment. White Fang tries to entice his mother into the woods but fails, for Kiche is comfortable in the camp. White Fang inevitably follows her there. However, Kiche is soon sent away with another Indian, Three Eagles, as payment for a debt that Gray Beaver owes him. A strip of scarlet cloth, a bearskin, twenty cartridges, and Kiche will go with Three Eagles up the Mackenzie River to the Great Slave Lake. White Fang follows Kiche into the water and heads after the canoe, but a blow from Three Eagles forces him back. Ignoring Gray Beavers calls, he continues to swim behind the canoe. Gray Beaver pursues White Fang in a canoe, overtakes him, lifts him by the nape of his neck, and beats him. White Fang bites back, only to be beaten harder. He learns an important lesson; never bite a human. Ashore, he is bitten by Lip-lip, who is beaten by Gray Beaver. White Fang limps behind Gray Beaver to the Indian village, where he must learn to adjust a life without his mother. As time passes, he still yearns for Kiche, but he grows comfortable in camp.", "analysis": ""}

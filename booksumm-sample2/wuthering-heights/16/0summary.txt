{"name": "Chapter 15", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210420090808/https://www.gradesaver.com/wuthering-heights/study-guide/summary-chapters-11-15", "summary": "The Sunday after Ellen's visit to Wuthering Heights, while most people were at church, she gave Catherine Heathcliff's letter. Catherine was changed by her sickness: she was beautiful in an unearthly way and her eyes \"appeared always to gaze beyond, and far beyond\". Ellen had left the door open, so Heathcliff walked in and Catherine eagerly waited for him to find the right room. Their reunion was bitter-sweet: though passionately glad to be reunited, Catherine accused Heathcliff of having killed her, and Heathcliff warned her not to say such things when he would be tortured by them after her death--besides, she had been at fault by abandoning him. She asked him to forgive her, since she would not be at peace after death, and he answered: \"It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those wasted hands. I love my murderer--but yours. How can I. They held each other closely and wept until Ellen warned them that Linton was returning. Heathcliff wanted to leave, but Catherine insisted that he stay, since she was dying and would never see him again. He consented to stay, and \"in the midst of the agitation, was sincerely glad to observe that Catherine's arms had fallen relaxed. She's fainted or dead, so much the better. Linton came in, and Heathcliff handed him Catherine's body and told him to take care of her: \"Unless you be a fiend, help her first then you shall speak to me. He told Nelly he would wait outside for news of Catherine's welfare, and left", "analysis": "Nelly may seem unfeeling in her unsympathetic descriptions of Catherine and Heathcliff, but her behavior to Hareton and Hindley  reveals her to be extremely tender-hearted and maternal at times. However, she is independent and spirited, and doesn't like to be bullied or imposed upon by Catherine, so she has no qualms about siding with Edgar Linton when her mistress is being temperamental. The strain imposed on the three characters--Catherine, Edgar, and Heathcliff--has finally resulted in outright violence: it is no longer possible to conceal the strength of the emotions involved. Edgar is in a particularly difficult situation: Catherine and Heathcliff are used to violent expressions of feeling, but he is not, and hates having to adjust to their modes of communication. He is more committed to gentility of behavior than the others, although they now appear as well-dressed and cultivated as he does. Heathcliff and Catherine call Edgar a \"lamb,\" a \"sucking leveret,\" and a \"milk-blooded coward\" . The first two insults are natural images that might easily come to mind for people who grew up on the moors; the third again uses the 'blood' imagery which appears to be central to the way they think about personality. In her delirium, Catherine reveals that her true emotional identity has not altered since she was twelve, just before she stayed with the Lintons for some weeks. Everything that happened to her since then ceases to have any importance when she is irrational: \"...supposing at twelve years old, I had been wrenched from the Heights, and every early association, and my all in all, as Heathcliff was at that time, and been converted, at a stroke, into Mrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross Grange, and the wife of a stranger; an exile, and outcast, thenceforth, from what had been my world  You may fancy a glimpse at the abyss where I groveled!\" Time is unimportant: it has no effect on the true, deep emotions in Bronte's world. Edgar's coldness to Isabella seems to result from his sister deserting him for his greatest enemy. His willingness to abandon her because of hurt pride is perhaps his greatest moral flaw. The emphasis he places on personal dignity differentiates him from the other characters--who certainly have many faults, though not that one. Isabella's reactions to her new home reveal her lack of inner fortitude: although she tries at first to stand up to Joseph and Hareton, her ladylike education has in no way prepared her for her married life, so when she loses her pride she has little else to fall back on. Her envy upon seeing Hindley's pistol is a little disconcerting, and she herself is horrified by it. It is worth noting the unfortunate position of women who depend on men: Isabella cannot escape from Heathcliff without the help of her brother, who does not want to help her. Surrounded by hatred and indifference, she can only fall back on Ellen's pity. This chapter includes a great deal of criticism of the Lintons: Edgar is called proud and unfeeling, and Heathcliff says that Isabella was actually attracted by his brutality until she herself suffered from it. Edgar's explanation of his refusal to write to Isabella is extremely unconvincing: \"I am not angry, but sorry to have lost her: especially as I can never think she'll be happy. It is out of the question my going to see her, however; we are eternally divided\" . Edgar is angry, of course, because he hates Heathcliff: presumably he is jealous of him. Heathcliff considers Edgar's version of love to be selfish, as though Edgar thought he owned his wife, and had a right to restrict her behavior: \"Had he been in my place, and I in his, though I hated him with a hatred that turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand against him... I never would have banished him from her society, as long as she desired his. Correspondingly, Heathcliff imagines Catherine's affection for Edgar in terms of property: \"He is scarcely a degree dearer to her than her dog, or her horse--it is not in him to be loved like me\" . Bronte has always associated the Lintons with material wealth. Heathcliff extends ideas of property and ownership to their emotions as well. Isabella's case is somewhat different. Heathcliff despises her because she loves him despite knowing what he is. This is an interesting point: Heathcliff is an obviously romantic figure, with his mysterious past, dark appearance, and passionate emotions. But Bronte makes it very clear that although he exerts a certain amount of fascination, he should in no way be considered a \"hero of romance\" . For doing so, Isabella is called a \"pitiful, slavish, mean-minded brach\" . In this very romantic novel, one can never rely on conventional notions of romance: through Heathcliff's character, Bronte suggests that brutality should never be considered attractive. Even Catherine does not find Heathcliff attractive--she simply finds him inescapable, a part of herself. The passionate scene between Catherine and Heathcliff in this chapter is probably the emotional climax of the novel, though it only marks the middle of the book. It reveals how little their love relies on pleasure: they can hardly be said to be fond of one another, or to enjoy each other's company, yet they are absolutely necessary to each other. It is as though they were members of a different species from other humans, and they belonged together. Ellen says: \"The two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearsome picture\" . Catherine tore Heathcliff's hair, and he left bruises on her arm. Later, he \"foamed like a mad dog, and gathered her to him with greedy jealousy.  did not feel as though  were in the company of a member of  own species\" . Love appears to be a form of madness. Catherine and Heathcliff's emotional reunion is counteracted by Ellen's cool and unsympathetic narration: their passionate conversation is interspersed with dry commentary on her part."}

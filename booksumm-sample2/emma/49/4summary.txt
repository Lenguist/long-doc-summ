She says that she has some news for him, and he replies that he had already heard about Jane and Frank Churchill this morning, right before he rode back. He starts to try to consol her, but she tells him that she does not need consoling. Mr. Knightley says that from the way she acted, he was sure she was attached to Frank Churchill. She tells him that she was never attached to him, and was sorry for her conduct. Mr. Knightley goes on to say that Frank Churchill is a disgrace, and that he is lucky to have gotten a wife like Jane at so young an age. Emma says that it seems like he envies Frank, and when he replies that he does, Emma feels that he is on the verge of speaking of Harriet. When he is about to talk more, Emma tells him not to reveal what he is about to, but to think about it more. He thanks her, and seems determined not to say any more. Emma feels bad and decides that she should listen, and tells him to speak to her openly as a friend. He tells Emma that he fears the word friend, and asks her if he does not have any chance of succeeding. He goes on to say that she has always been the dearest to him. Emma does not know what to say, she is so happy. As Mr. Knightley goes on to say how much he loves her, Emma realizes that Harriet's hopes were groundless, and that she herself is everything to Mr. Knightley. Emma tells him that he has no need to despair, and that he may speak more on the subject. He tells her that it was because of jealousy of Frank that he left for London, and that he only returned to comfort Emma. When he found her in the garden, things just happened, as he had not planned on approaching her", "analysis": ""}

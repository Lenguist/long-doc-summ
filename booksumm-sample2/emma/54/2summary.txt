{"name": "volume 3, Chapter 54", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227043948/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/emma/section18/", "summary": "Mr. Knightley has news for Emma: Harriet is to marry Robert Martin. Knightley had sent Mr. Martin to London with a package for his brother while Harriet was there, and Mr. Martin began to spend time with the family. Knightley worries that Emma is upset, but in fact she is thrilled, amazed, and amused at Harriet's rapid recovery. Emma is thankful that she has not done Harriet greater injury, and she is glad that soon she will no longer need to conceal Harriet's emotional state from Knightley. Emma and Mr. Knightley go to visit Randalls and find Frank and Jane there. At first, Emma's meeting with Frank is awkward, but soon they are back on easy terms, joking about all that has passed. Frank's ability to speak lightly of all he and Jane have suffered is not entirely approved by his fiancee, and Emma feels Knightley's superiority to Frank", "analysis": "Although Emma ends in the traditional manner of a comedy, with a series of weddings to secure everyone's happiness and reaffirm social ties, the question of whether or not the novel's ending is truly happy is often posed. Some critics suggest that Emma regresses, rather than develops, at the end of the novel because she exchanges her independence, energy, and wit for a wish \"to grow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgments had been ever so superior to her own . . . that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future.\" Instead of marrying a man who is her equal, Emma marries a father figure, and, not only will she not be traveling beyond Highbury, she will not even leave her own father's home. Emma's and Mr. Knightley's reminiscences about her childhood remind us that his main role in her life has been as an authority figure and underline the fact that a large portion of her love for him is as someone who can be depended upon to guide her. She is so used to calling him \"Mr. Knightley\" that she says she will only call him \"George\" on their wedding day. Emma's position at the end of the novel is strikingly similar to the position she was in at the beginning.  Also, Emma's thoughts about Harriet indicate that Emma has grown more selfish. She takes for granted that their differing social positions mean that they must give up their intimacy. She does not seem to regret her decision or miss Harriet, suggesting that the need to adhere to social conventions overwhelms the affection that she has for Harriet. Emma's thoughts following the revelation of Harriet's parentage demonstrate that class distinctions have value for Emma apart from their association with personal virtue:  Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for! It was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what a connection had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley, or for the Churchills, or even for Mr. Elton! The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.  In other words, a match between a gentleman and the illegitimate daughter of a tradesperson would be a true contamination. Although at some points the novel seems to entertain the idea that class distinctions might be unfair or unfortunate, ultimately the novel is decidedly conservative. Austen demonstrates that the happiness of a marriage depends upon the couple's being appropriately matched, rather than one of the parties trying to rise above his or her class background."}
